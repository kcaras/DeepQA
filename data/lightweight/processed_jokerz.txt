Cats are cool because you don't have to buy them. You see them on the street, take them home -- they're yours. You ain't never seen a cat being bought out of a pet store. They just sit in the pet store. They're under there like, 'Meow,' and you be looking at them like, 'Oh they're so cute. Let's go find one like that.'
I look to nature because I think the animals are smarter than we are. Animals mate; humans date. There's no dating in the animal kingdom. No dinner, no movie -- just a quick sniff, 'Alright, let's go.'

An elderly lady phoned her telephone company to report that her telephone failed to ring when her friends called - and that on the few occasions when it did ring, her pet dog always moaned right before the phone rang. The telephone repairman proceeded to the scene, curious to see this psychic dog or senile elderly lady.He climbed a nearby telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed the subscriber's house. The phone didn't ring right away, but then the dog moaned loudly and the telephone began to ring.Climbing down from the pole, the telephone repairman found:1. The dog was tied to the telephone system's ground wire via a steel chain and collar. 2. The wire connection to the ground rod was loose.3. The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the phone number was called.4. After a couple of such jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate on himself and the ground.5. The wet ground would complete the circuit, thus causing the phoneto ring.Which demonstrates that some problems CAN be fixed by pissing andmoaning.

I'm not making this up -- he goes 'Now if your neighbor marries a box turtle, that doesn't affect your everyday life. But that doesn't mean it's right.' I think it's pretty safe to assume that, at one point or another, Senator John Cornyn has thought about making love to a box turtle. I'm sorry, but that's not the first animal you jump to when you're writing that analogy.
Clem pulled over the car by the side of the road and showed Jed where he'd first had sex."It was right down there by that tree. I remember the day plainly. It was a warm summer day. She and I were so much in love. We walked down to the tree and made love for hours," Clem recalled."That sounds wonderful," said Jed."Yes.

I don't eat food that a dog won't touch. That's my guideline. Try to give tofu to a dog. He goes, 'I don't think so. No.' It's a dog. It licks between its legs and sniffs fire hydrants. If he doesn't like something, I go with that opinion. He's drinking out of the toilet. Find out what he thinks.

Maybe you could examine me and find out?"So, the snake felt the bunny. "Well, you're soft and cuddly," said the snake. "You have long silky ears and a little fluffy tail. You must be a bunny!""Awesome!" says the bunny. "Now what kind of animal are you?""I really don't know," says the snake. "I've never seen myself.

Tired of constant blonde jokes, a blonde dyes her hair brown. She goes for a drive in the country and sees a shepherd herding his sheep across the road."Hey, shepherd, if I guess how many sheep are here, can I keep one?" she asks. The shepherd agrees. She blurts out, "352!"The shepherd is stunned but keeps his word and allows her to pick a sheep."I'll take this one," she says proudly. "It's the cutest!""Hey lady," says the shepherd.

You guys familiar with Elliot's Peripheral Extrapolation Theorem? That's the one that states that depending on the size of an enclosure, i.e. an aquarium or terrarium, that the animal, i.e. fish or lizard, that you put in that area will grow depending on the size and the room it has to grow in. And based on that, I've been wearing some very large underwear.

I love dogs because there's no filter mechanism between the dog's brain and its tail. There's no filter there. Like, if the dog is happy, the tail is wagging; if the tail is wagging, the dog is happy. There's no passive aggressive sh*t like humans, like, 'Oh this douchebag thinks I'm happy to see him.'
An old farmer went to town to see a movie. The ticket agent asked, "Sir, what's that on your shoulder?"The old farmer said, "That's my pet rooster Chucky, wherever I go, Chucky goes.""I'm sorry sir.", said the ticket agent, "We don't allow animals in the theater."The old farmer went around the corner and stuffed the bird down his pants. He returned to the booth, bought a ticket and entered the theater. He sat down next to two old widows named Mildred and Marge.The movie started and the rooster began to squirm. The old farmer unzipped his pants so Chucky could stick his head out and watch the movie."Marge", whispered Mildred."What", said Marge."I think this guy next to me is a pervert.", said Mildred."What makes you think that", asked Marge."He unzipped his pants and he has his thing out", whispered Mildred."Well, don't worry about it", said Marge, "At our age we've seen them all.""I thought so", said Mildred, "But this one is eating my popcorn!"

If a farmer was only able to choose between buying a cow or a tractor, what should he pick. On one hand, he would look funny riding on a cow.  On the other hand, he would look funnier trying to milk a tractor.
An old cowhand came riding into town on a hot, dry, dusty day. The local sheriff watched from his chair in front of the saloon as the cowboy wearily dismounted and tied his horse to the rail. The cowboy then moved slowly to the back of his horse, lifted its tail, and placed a big kiss where the sun don't shine. He dropped the horse's tail, stepped up on the walk and aimed toward the swinging doors of the saloon."Hold on there, Mister," said the sheriff. "Did I just see what I think I saw?""Reckon you did, Sheriff. I got me some powerful chapped lips.""And that cures them?" the Sheriff asked."Nope, but it keeps me from lickin' 'em."

If a dolphin was ugly and tasted good, we'd be eating it by the truckload. No one would care. The only negative thing that ever happened to a tuna was it was born butt ugly and it mixes well with mayo.
We don't not-eat the dolphins because they're cute. We don't eat the dolphins because they're 'intelligent' -- people have said that to me -- which I think is really stupid logic. I suppose if you're going to use that kind of rationale, then we should be eating the retarded.

Whenever we use similes for some reason, we always use animals. And I'll show you what I mean. They say a man's an animal trying to pick up a girl at a bar. He likes to show her he's strong as an ox, sly as a fox, memory like an elephant, can become slippery as an eel, a regular snake in the grass. Girl likes that; she's going home with him. They're snug as two bugs in a rug. So they go home. They hump like rabbits. Unfortunately, he's quick as a bunny. She's depressed. She goes right into the refrigerator. She's hungry as a bear, eats like a pig. He goes to the liquor cabinet, gets drunk as a skunk. He drinks like a fish; he's blind as a bat.

A man buys several sheep, hoping to breed them for wool. After several weeks, he notices that none of the sheep are getting pregnant, and calls a vet for help. The vet tells him that he should try artificial insemination.The guy doesn't have the slightest idea what this means but not wanting to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the sheep are pregnant. The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and will lie down and wallow in the grass.The man hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the sheep. So, he loads the sheep into his truck, drives them out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings them back, and goes to bed.The next morning, he wakes and looks out at the sheep. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he concludes that the first try didn't take, and loads them in the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, bangs each sheep twice for good measure, brings them back, and goes to bed.The next morning he wakes to find the sheep still just standing around. One more try, he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day shagging the sheep and upon returning home, falls listlessly into bed.The next morning, he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look at the sheep. He asks his wife to look out and tell him if the sheep are lying in the grass."No," she says, "they're all in the truck and one of them is honking the horn."

There are many different kinds of a**holes in the world.... But there's one particular kind of a**hole that you see at the airport that's so annoying, and that is the person that is dressed like the destination to which it is they are flying. Do you know what I'm saying? The people that wear what they think the native costume of the land is that their going to... We're going to Denver, and I swear to you, this motherf**ker had a parka made of bears.

Last night I could not get to sleep; I'm just flipping around in my bed, can't get to sleep. So here's what I do: I wake up at three in the morning, I go over to Krispy Kreme donuts. I buy two lovely honey-glazed donuts. I stick them to my eyes, and I climb up into a pine tree and pretend I'm an owl.

You gotta feel bad for flies, though, huh? Lowly little thing on the totem pole. What happened when they were giving that out? Like lion: Lion, you will be king of the beasts and reign supreme over all other creatures. Fly: you will fly all around, and when you get tired, you will land on pooh.
Here's what you do to get rid of spiders: go out, catch some flies, dip them into Tabasco sauce and flick them into the web.

I'm trying to quit because I found out they're using caffeine as an insecticide now. They're spraying it over the crops in Texas to kill the bugs. I said, 'I'm putting that in my body every day?' Just to prove I'm wrong, the other night in my apartment, I took a cup of coffee, poured it all along the floorboards of my kitchen. Not only did it leave the roaches alive, they kept me up all night talking.
An old farmer and his wife had a bunch of pigs, and every morning the farmer would head out to feed them. And every morning, he would see all the pigs screwing up a storm. He would get turned on by this and try to get back to the house in time to screw his wife -- but he always got soft before he got there. So one day, he took his hatchet and headed out to the pig pen."No!" said his wife. "Don't kill those pigs!""I'm not going to kill them. I'm moving the pen closer to the house."

I miss having a pet. We're not allowed to have dogs in my building. We're allowed to have cats. My friend's like, 'Why don't you get a cat?'

It just looks bad: you're either gay or you're a villain.
It's the kind of dog that's so small that it's just shivering all the time. It could be 90 degrees out, but the dog's just shivering because it's so small, it couldn't retain body heat in a microwave. What happened to Darwin, survival of the fittest? If the dog needs a sweater, it doesn't deserve to live.

Growing up, we named our family dog after my dad. Our dog's name was Dad. That got confusing, as you can probably imagine. Like one time at a family gathering, Dad crapped on the carpet. I wasn't there to see it happen; I was out walking the dog. Ruined Mother's Day. 'Mother' is our cat.
I like to sit around with my friends and of course the conversation always leads to, 'What is the most philanthropic animal?' A lot of people think it's the dog because it helps blind people around. No, the dog's trained to do that, doesn't want to do that. Crickets are the most philanthropic. They let blind people know when it's nighttime.

I never really had pets when I was a kid. There was one time I asked my mom for a puppy. She was like, 'Nah, puppies cost too much. I'm gonna get you a dog from the shelter. They cheaper.'

People who are against hunting, the biggest thing they quote is that it's not fair. It's very unfair for the animal: the guy's got a gun, he's up in a tree, he's hidden, the animal's unsuspecting, and it's not fair. And I would agree with that -- it's not fair. But my father called me recently with his plan to go grizzly bear hunting with a bow and arrow... If that was a fight in Vegas, the bear would be like a 25-to-1 favorite.

Every time I see a politician on the campaign trail, they make all kinds of promises they have no intention of living up to. Basically, our election system has become a more sophisticated version of that game you used to play with your dog when you were a kid, where you'd take a tennis ball and fake throw it and watch him run out and try to find it. 'What is that? Is that healthcare? You want healthcare, don't you? Go get it!'

A guy was seated next to a 10-year-old girl on an airplane. Being bored, he turned to the girl and said, "Let's talk. I've heard that flights go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger."The girl, who was reading a book, closed it slowly and said to the guy, "What would you like to talk about?""Oh, I don't know," said the guy. "How about nuclear power?""OK," she said. "That could be an interesting topic. But let me ask you a question first. A horse, a cow and a deer all eat the same stuff... grass. Yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, and a horse produces clumps of dried grass. Why do you suppose that is?"The guy thought about it and said, "Hmmm, I have no idea."To which the girl replied, "Do you really feel qualified to discuss nuclear power when you don't know s**t?"

He'll pull up your little red dress, pull down your little red panties and freak your little red socks off!"She told them,  "Don't worry, I've got a gun."About two more miles down the road, the Big Bad Wolf leapt out of the forest and grabbed Lil' Red. He shouted "Ha! I finally caught you!"And she cried, "Don't tell me you're gonna pull up my little red dress, pull down my little red panties and freak my little red socks off.""Yes I am," said the Wolf, drooling."No, you ain't," said Little Red."What do you mean," said the Wolf, taken aback.Lil' Red pulled up her little red dress, pulled down her little red panties, pulled out her big silver gun and said, "Nope, you're gonna eat me like it says in the book."

Once there was a farmer.  He had two teenage sons.    This farmer had just inherited some of money from his brother's recent death.  He couldn't decide   which son he could send to college, since he could only afford to send one.This farmer also had two ducks.  These ducks were retarded.  They were only two ducks on the farm that weren't normal.  He told his sons that whoever could get the most money for the duck would go to college.The sons   went out in attempt to collect as much money as   they could.    The first son was walking down the street when he passed a man working in the yard.  The man asked him if the duck was for sale, for the man loved the taste of ducks.  He offered the son 10 dollars for his duck.  The son decided this was very good, so he took it.  He decided his brother wouldn't be able to get close to his success.The second son was walking and passed a whorehouse.  He went in and said that he didn't have any money, but he would give them the duck.  One girl said fine. After they f**ked, she decided that she didn't want the duck anymore.  The son said he would take the duck back if they f**ked again.  She agreed.  After they f**ked the second time, the son left.He was walking home, thinking about what to do with the duck when it broke the leash.  The duck ran out into the street and was hit by a car.  The lady that hit it jumped from her car and started apologizing profusely.  The son insisted it was ok, but the lady said she would pay for the duck.  She was in a hurry, so she gave him 25 dollars and sped off.When the sons got home, the farmer asked the first son what he got.  He proudly displayed the 10 dollars.  The farmer was impressed.  He asked the second son the same thing."That's nothing.  I got a f**k for a duck, a duck for a f**k, and 25 dollars for a f**ked up duck."

I just read an article in the paper the other day that, in an experiment, a medical experiment, they actually hooked up electrodes to the pleasure center of a lab monkey's brain and, at the flip of a switch, sent the monkey into perpetual orgasm. I've always been against animal testing, but where do I get the home game of this?
The weirdest part of that whole story was that it was still there. I'm thinking, aren't there any dogs in that neighborhood? That thing would have been snatched up like that in my neighborhood.

So this is what I would do if I found this kitten: I would take her and I would shave her and I would dye her purple and I'd put little leather pants on her and I'd teach her to talk somehow -- I don't know how -- and I'd bring her back, and I'd be like, 'Here's Fluffy!' And they'd be like, 'What happened?' And I'd say, 'Oh ba-da-da-da-da -- sorry, I believe the little flyer here said no questions asked.'

I'm not an outdoorsy guy. My buddy in Central Pennsylvania used to hunt deer, and that's way more complex than I thought. You got to track the animal for, like, two or three days. And at the end of it, you may or may not get a kill. He told me that. I'm like, 'Forget that, dude. I kill a deer in my car while I'm speeding and text messaging at the same time. It's not that difficult, bro.'

I think a rotisserie is like a really morbid ferris wheel for chickens. It's a strange piece of machinery. We will take the chicken, kill it, impale it and then rotate it. And I'll be damned if I'm not hungry because spinning chicken carcasses make my mouth water. I like dizzy chicken.
I went to a Subway sandwich shop, and I said, 'Let me have a bun,' but she wouldn't sell me just a bun. She said it had to have something on it. She told me it's against regulations for Subway to sell just a bun; I guess the two halves ain't supposed to touch. So, I said, 'Alright, put some lettuce on it,' which they did. They said, 'That'll be $1.75.' I said, 'It's for a duck.' They said, 'Alright, well then it's free.' See, I did not know that -- ducks eat for free at Subway. Had I known that, I would've ordered a much larger sandwich. 'Lemme have the steak fajita sandwich, but don't bother ringing it up, it's for a duck! There are six ducks out there, and they all want SunChips!'

A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. The horse falls into a mud hole and starts to sink. He entreats the chicken to get the farmer to help pull him to safety. The chicken runs to the farm, but the farmer can't be found. So, he drives the farmer's Mercedes back to the mud hole, ties some rope around the bumper and pulls the horse to safety.A few days later, the chicken and the horse are playing in the meadow again, and the chicken falls into a mud hole. The chicken yells to the horse to get help from the farmer. The horse says, "Wait, I think I can stand over the hole!" So, he stretches over the width of the hole and says, "Grab my penis and pull yourself up." The chicken does and pulls himself to safety.The moral of the story: if you are hung like a horse, you don't need a Mercedes to pick up chicks.
A hound dog lays in the yard and an old man in overalls sits on the porch."Excuse me, sir, but does your dog bite?" a jogger asks.The old man looks over his newspaper and replies, "Nope."As soon as the jogger enters the yard, the dog begins snarling and growling, and then attacks the jogger's legs. As the jogger flails around in the yard, he yells, "I thought you said your dog didn't bite!"The old man mutters, "Ain't my dog."

I don't like the word 'boobies' -- disrespectful to women. Boobies? They should be called 'yaybies.' How about that, everybody? Why is 'boo' in it when they're awesome? They should be yaybies or hooraybies or standing ovabies. If they're not perfect, they're still OKabies. They are not great persabies, but I'll touch them maybes. Feel free to use any of those. I would avoid hooraybies -- that sounds like a disease. Some kind of herpes/rabies combo that you get when a dog bites your junk.
They get so religiously extreme that they deny reality. They're like, 'Gay doesn't exist. You don't see gay in the natural world.' You know what I don't see as much in the natural world?

NASA engineers build a cannon that launches dead chickens at the windshields of airplanes, military jets and such to test the strength of the windshields against collisions with airborne fowl.British engineers are eager to test it on the windshields of their new high-speed trains. Arrangements are made, and a cannon is sent to the British engineers.When the cannon goes off, the engineers stand shocked as the chicken crashes into the shatterproof shield, smashes it to smithereens, blasts through the control console, snaps the pilot's backrest in two, and embeds itself in the back wall of the cabin.The horrified Brits send the Americans a report of the disastrous results, along with an urgent request for suggests on improving the windshield design.The American engineers respond with a one-line memo: "Thaw the chicken."

Recently, a friend and I were talking about genetic engineering -- and no, we weren't high. My friend was saying how great it would be if you could make a cat as big as a dog -- you know, have like a house cat and make it as big as like, you know, a golden retriever or something -- because then, it would be like a tame jungle cat running around your house, you know?

I think they should have mirrors in the wild, because if some of these wild animals saw themselves, they wouldn't be so cocky. Think about it -- how you look affects how you feel. Why wouldn't that be true for the wild animal kingdom?

A pheasant says to a bull, "I would love to get on top of that tree, but I haven't the energy.""Well," says the bull, "why don't you eat some of my dung? It's packed with nutrients."So the pheasant eats some dung and finds that it gives him enough energy to get to the first branch. The next day, he eats some more and gets to the next branch. This cycle continues for a week. Finally, the pheasant is at the top of the tree, where he is spotted by the farmer, who shoots him with a shotgun.Moral of the Story:  bullsh*t might take you to the top, but it won't keep you there.

There were four country churches in a small Texas town: The Presbyterian Church, the Baptist Church, the Methodist Church and the Catholic Church. Each church was overrun with pesky squirrels.One day, the Presbyterian Church called a meeting to decide what to do about the squirrels. After much prayer and consideration they determined that the squirrels were predestined to be there and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will.In the Baptist Church the squirrels had taken up habitation in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a cover on the baptistery and drown the squirrels in it. The squirrels escaped somehow and there were twice as many there the next week.The Methodist Church got together and decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creation. So, they humanely trapped the Squirrels and set them free a few miles outside of town. Three days later, the squirrels were back.But -- The Catholic Church came up with the best and most effective solution. They baptized the squirrels and registered them as members of the church. Now they only see them on Christmas and Easter.

Two blondes suddenly got into bird hunting and were eager to try it out for themselves. They had read that a birddog is a great and useful accessory in bird hunting, so they decided to go to the pet shop and buy one. They asked for a well-trained birddog, and got one. The two blondes immediately went to the woods to try it out. The dog didn't work. No matter how hard they tried, it just didn't follow their commands. They became really frustrated and one of the blondes said to her companion, Okay, we'll give him one more try. We'll throw him in the air one more time and if he doesn't fly, we're taking him back to the store!

Scientists at NASA have developed a gun built specifically to launch dead chickens at the windshields of airliners, military jets and the space shuttle, all traveling at maximum velocity.The idea is to simulate the frequent incidents of collisions with airborne fowl to test the strength of the windshields.British engineers heard about the gun and were eager to test it on the windshield of their new high speed trains.   Arrangements were made.  But when the gun was fired, the engineers stood shocked as the chicken hurtled out of the barrel, crashed into the shatterproof shield, smashed it to smithereens, crashed through the control console, snapped the engineer's backrest in two and embedded itself in the back wall of the cabin.Horrified Britons sent NASA the disastrous results of the experiment, along with the designs of the windshield, and begged the U.S. scientists for suggestions.NASA's response was just three words, "Thaw the chicken."

An old farmer decided it was time to get a new rooster for his hens.  The current rooster was   still doing an okay job, but he was getting on in  years and the farmer figured getting a new rooster   couldn't hurt.  So he buys a new cock from the   local rooster emporium, and turns him loose in the   barnyard.    Well, the old rooster sees the young one strutting   around and he's a little worried about being replaced. He walks up to   the new bird."So you're the new stud in   town?  I bet you really think you're hot stuff   don't you?  Well I'm not ready for the chopping   block yet.  I'll bet I'm still the better bird.    And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around   that hen house over there.  We'll run around it   ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have   all the hens for himself."Well, the young rooster was a proud sort, and he   definitely thought he was more than a match for   the old guy."You're on," he said, "and since   I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of   half a lap.  I'll still win easy!"So the two roosters go over to the henhouse to   start the race with all the hens gathering to   watch.  The race begins and all the hens start   cheering the old rooster on.  After the first lap,   the old rooster is still maintaining his lead.After the second lap, the old guy's lead has   slipped a little -- but he's still hanging in there.  Unfortunately, the old rooster's lead continues to   slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he's   just barely in front of the young fella.    By now the farmer has heard the commotion.  He   runs into the house, gets his shotgun and runs   into the barnyard figuring a fox or something is   after his chickens.  When he gets there, he sees   the two roosters running around the henhouse,   with the old rooster still slightly in the lead.    He immediately takes his shotgun, aims, fires, and   blows the young rooster away."Damn. That's the third gay rooster I've bought this month."

Once there was a farmer with three sons. He gave a duck to his eldest son and told him to see how much money he could get for it at the market. The eldest son came back later in the day, shouting "Dad, I got $10 for the duck!"The farmer said "Well done, son."The next day, the farmer sent the middle son to the market with a duck and he came back with $20. "Well done, son," said the farmer.He then sent the youngest son to the market to see how much he could get for the duck. On the way to the market, the son met a prostitute."I'll give you a f**k if you give me that duck," said the prostitute. After they did it, the prostitute said, "That was so good, I'll give you the duck back if you f**k me again."

When the ark's door was closed, Noah called a meeting with all the animals and said in a demanding voice:"Listen up kids! There will be NO sex on this trip. Not even the wetting of the tip of your penis. All of you males, take off your penises and hand them to Jim the Monkey. He will write you a receipt. After we see land, you can get your penis back."After about a week, Mr. Rabbit ran over to his wife and very excitedly said, "Quick! Get on my shoulders and look out the window to see if there is any land out there!"Mrs. Rabbit got onto his shoulders, looked out the window and said, "Sorry, no land yet.""S**t!" shouted Mr. Rabbit and out he went.This went on every day until Mrs. Rabbit got fed up with him."What is the matter with you? You know it will rain for forty days and nights. Only after the water had drained will we be able to see land. But why are you acting so excited every day?""Look!" said Mr. Rabbit with an impatient look on his face as he held out a piece of paper. "I GOT THE DONKEY'S RECEIPT!"

One day, a farmer was tending to his livestock when he noticed that one of his cows was completely cross-eyed. He called up a veterinarian friend of his who told him to bring in his cow. The vet took one look at the cow, stuck a tube up the cow's butt, and blew into the tube until the cow's eyes straightened out. The vet charged the farmer a hundred bucks, and the farmer went home happy. About a week later, the cow's eyes were cross-eyed again, but this time the farmer figured he could probably take care of it himself. So he called his hired hand over, and together they put a tube up the cow's butt. The farmer put his lips to the tube and started to blow. Strangely, nothing happened, so he asked his hired hand to give it a try. The hired hand removed the tube, turned it around, put it in the cow's butt and started to blow."What are you doing?" asked the farmer, horrified."Well, I wasn't gonna use the side that YOU had put your lips on."

So they had the final; the Mayor fired the starting pistol and they started eating the tench.  No sooner had Mr. Hicks bitten the fish than one of his teeth fell out.

''What did you want to tell me?''''Hey, Teddy,'' the rabbit began, ''look how many berries are on the other side of the river.''

A farm boy who had just finished his schooling on the farm, was sent by his Ma and Pa to the big city to go to college. The first thing the boy does when he gets to town, is go to find a whorehouse. He goes inside to talk to the madam about getting a girl. She leads him upstairs, opens the door to a room and tells him to sit and wait for the girl to arrive.After several minutes of anxious waiting, a young, blonde prostitute comes in. The boy is beside himself, and he leaps up from the bed, grabs the television, and throws it out the window. The girl thinks this is odd behavior, but she shrugs it off, and begins to undress.

Three nuns used to go to the church from their homes every day. On the way they would pass a house where a parrot lived. The parrot would call out three colors every time the nuns would pass  by. They soon realized that the parrot was calling out the colors of their respective underpants. They tried to fool the parrot by switching positions while walking and even wearing different colored underpants every day, but the parrot was never wrong.    Finally they devised a way to fool the parrot by not wearing any underpants at all. When they walked across the house the parrot spoke out loud, ''Straight, straight, curly.''

Three  turtles, Joe, Steve, and Poncho, decide to   go on a picnic.  Joe packs the picnic basket   with cookies, bottled sodas, and sandwiches. The trouble is, the picnic site is 10 miles away, so the turtles take 10 whole days to get there.By the time they do arrive, everyone's whipped and hungry. Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and realizes that they forgot to bring a bottle opener.   Joe & Steve beg Poncho to turn back home   and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses,   knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back.Somehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food.    So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and   steady.Twenty days pass, but no Poncho.  Joe   and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise.

There once was a toad that was excluded from all Green Toad activities because he was a handsome shade of yellow. So he went to visit a beautiful fairy in the town over who had the power to grant wishes."Fairy," he said. "I would like to be green, so I can play with all the other toads.""Granted!" said the fairy, who turned him yellow. Unfortunately, his little toady penis was still yellow."What about my penis?" he asked the fairy."Oh! For that, you'll have to go see the wizard." And so the toad hopped off to find the wizard. Soon, a pink elephant visited the fairy, and he wished to be turned gray. She granted him the wish, but, as with the toad, his penis was still pink. So she told him to visit the wizard."How do I find the wizard?" he asked."Just follow the yellow d**k toad."

Jack tells his doctor how he can no longer sustain an erection.After a complete examination the doctor tells Jack, "The problem is that the musclesaround the base of your penis are damaged. There's really nothing I can do unless you're willing to try an experimental treatment. We would take the muscles from the trunk of a baby elephant and implant them in your penis."The thought of going through life without ever having sex again was too much for Jack, so he agreed to try the treatment.  A few weeks after the operation, Jack was given the green light to try out his new equipment.  He planned a romantic evening for his girlfriend and took her to one of the nicest restaurants in the city.During dinner he felt a pain building in his groin. To release the pressure, Jack unzipped his fly.  His penis immediately sprang from his fly, went to the top of the table, grabbed a roll, and then returned to his pants. His girlfriend was stunned at first but then said with a sly smile, "That was incredible! Can you do it again?"''I can try," said Jack, "but I don't think my ass can take another roll."

It's the airport. It's like playing 'Wheel of Fortune': 'For $7,500, may I have the nachos, please? I was thinking about that home in Versailles, but I thought, nah, maybe I'll just have the pepperoni slice.'
===
Tear gas.
What's brown and lives in a bell tower?
===
We walked up to the podium, and I said to the girl behind the podium, I said, 'We would like a table, please.' And she said, 'I'm sorry, sir, there are no tables available right now. You'll have to go in the waiting room and wait.' So, we went in the waiting room, and while we were waiting in the waiting room, I couldn't help but think, 'Why don't they just put some tables in here?'
I like my coffee like I like my slaves -- free.

Being Puerto Rican in New York, I grew up -- I swear to you -- thinking that White Castle hamburgers was traditional, indigenous Puerto Rican food.
A blonde orders a pizza and is asked if she wants it cut into six or 12 pieces.She responds, "Six, please. I could never eat 12 pieces."

What did the blonde say when she saw a box of Cheerios?
"Wow! Doughnut seeds!"
===
Why don't blondes eat pickles?
They can't get their heads in the jars.
===
I only made it 11 days. I had to quit. I was backed up like the mall parking lot at Christmas time.
Do you ever get the waiter who wants to tell you his name? I don't want to know your name. I've got stuff to do. I mean, I'm a really nice guy, but I already have friends. If you're going to Applebee's to make friends with the wait staff, you've got a whole bunch of other problems.
===
The minute they put the nachos on the table, everybody becomes an enemy because there's all different kinds of nachos. Do you ever see those naked ones around the perimeter? Then, there's that one big Powerball nacho that somehow is connected to all the other nachos on the plate -- it's like the Kevin Bacon of nachos.
The first thing I do after we order the pizza, I take off all my clothes. That way I don't have to answer the door when the pizza guy shows up.
===
Do you ever see your nana reach in for the good nacho with her nana hand? And in your head you think, 'You son of a bitch.' You don't think, 'Oh golly gosh, Nana. You're a rascal.' No, you think, 'Nana is a son of a bitch.' You don't say it, but what if we had Tourette Nacho Syndrome? Where she grabs onto the nacho: 'Really, Nana? You whore!'
There's no relationship here, Travis. I tell you what I want: you go get it; I give you some money; then, you go away -- like a food hooker.
===
Caught my last girlfriend cheating on me. She was at a Sizzler, laying in the all-you-can-eat salad bar.
It's kind of hard losing weight, though, when every time you see a sign that says, 'World's Best Donut,' you take it as a personal challenge. You're like, 'I'll see about that. Oh, you're right, this is a good donut. I'll take seven dozen and a diet coke.'
===
So I'm on the way in here tonight, and I see this panhandler, this homeless guy, right? And he's trying to bum some change off me for food -- while he was eating! Totally unprofessional.
Grew up in a small town where there was only one crazy guy. He didn't even go insane doing anything good, like going to 'Nam or having an extended acid trip. Turns out -- legend has it -- he just had some bad cheese.
===
I was reading a Fig Newtons label -- I've always liked them, and I was trying to see if it was OK to eat them. Everything looked pretty good, the fat content and everything. So, I'm thinking I could eat these. I looked at the serving size: two cookies. Who the hell eats two cookies? I eat Fig Newtons by the sleeve. Two sleeves is a serving size.
I have a friend who swears by food combinations -- have you heard of this nonsense? She's nuts. She's like, 'You know what? You should eat food combinations, and that way you can eat whatever you want. It's just the combinations of how you put the food together.' And then her examples are like, 'You wouldn't want to eat steak and potatoes together, but you could have, like, a lemon rind and raisin skins -- not the whole raisin, take the skins and steam them.'
===
You can microwave a Pop Tart. That just blew me away that you could do that. How long does it take to toast a Pop Tart? A minute and a half if you want it dark? People don't have that kind of time? Listen, if you need to zap-fry your Pop Tarts before you head out the door, you might want to loosen up your schedule.
I eat like a kid. I like Chef Boyardee, the ravioli. But they have some stuff I've never seen in the real Italian food world. You ever been in a nice Italian restaurant: 'Hi, how are you? Like to start with a nice bottle of Chianti and a couple of Cesar salads to get started and, um, I'm going to have the Beef-a-Roni -- and some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the lady.'
===
You guys keeping up on that Jeffrey Dahmer thing, the guy that ate 17 people? You know, I could understand one or two, but 17 -- you're eating just to eat.
I'll pound your meat any way you want me to.

I was working recently in London -- what a thrill, yeah. But I wasn't used to their money, though, 'cause I bought this really decadent box of chocolates -- the cashier said, 'That'll be 10 pounds.' I'm like, 'Rub it in, why don't you?'
Her friends are a**holes. They always try to belittle me because they all have PhD's and I didn't finish college. Like, one night, we're all out getting dinner, and this one guy's like, 'So, Chad, have you ever had Indian food?' I was like, 'Hello? Thanksgiving.'
===
Nacho cheese.
How do you know if a chef is a clown?

I met my first midget in Mexico, and he was a waiter with a sombrero on his head, filled with chips and salsa. Like I was gonna let that guy get away -- I don't think so.
What do you get when you mix chocolate and Viagra?
===
Let me get this straight. We invade a country with oil, but gas costs more? That don't make no f**king sense! Now I didn't go to no fancy school or nothing, but I'll tell you this right now -- if I invade Kentucky Fried Chicken, wings will be cheap at my house.
I stop at a Burger King. I wasn't hungry; I just go in to harass the employees. I go and I address them by their first name. This confuses the hell out of them because they have forgotten they're wearing a name tag.
===
If this place is a meat market, you are the prime rib.
Do you have any raisins? How about a date?
===
Halloween is pay day, folks. A lot of parents are strange; they say, 'Ration the candy.' I say, 'Let them eat as much as they want -- they throw up, the rest is mine.' That's how I handle Halloween.
I met a guy in a bar, which is generally not a good idea. That's like going grocery shopping when you're hungry and you bring home stuff that you don't need.
===
My brother's trying to get me to fast. My brother said, 'You gotta fast, like, every month so you can pure your system.' I'm like, 'You know what? When we was back in the projects, we fasted.'
People change in Hollywood. My brothers, now -- they're all vegetarians... They say, 'Hey man, you shouldn't eat hot sauce. It's got sodium in it.' I'm like, 'When'd you start reading hot sauce?'
===
I'm amazed how many people will say they're a vegetarian and then add, 'Well, I eat a little chicken.' Well, then you're not a vegetarian. You're what's known as a liar.
I went to the Carnegie Deli, and I had one of the celebrity sandwiches. I had the Joe Franklin, and what they do is they serve the dressing on the side, and they comb it over the sandwich.

Anytime there was a problem in the world, we'd send troops. Now, anytime there's a problem in the world, we send food. Problem in Bosnia, we send them food. Problem in Somalia, we send them food. Clinton's like my mom.
My daughter will say she's hungry, and I'm like, 'Buddy, you're just bored. Do you understand? And you're already starting a pattern of satisfying an internal disconnect with an external stimulation, and that's a dead-end road, sweetie. Courtney Love lives on that road; you don't want to live on that road.'
===
I never got a birds and the bees speech as a child. The closest thing I ever got -- one time, my dad was cooking breakfast; he's like, 'Sex is a lot like this egg. First thing you gotta do is heat up the bed real nice, get it nice and warm, get it ready for her. Then, you gotta take her, crack her over the head and lay her out flat, alright? Come on now -- wait 'til she starts sizzlin' really good, then you can flip her on over -- there ya go. Don't get too excited or you get yellow stuff all over the bacon.'
If you had to eat another human being to survive, do you think they taste like their ethnic background?  Mexicans are spicy? Do you have to have chips and salsa before you bite into one? Chinese people: are you hungry 30 minutes later for more? Let's go everybody -- black people: taste like chicken... I did that joke one night and, of course, a white lady came running up to me after the show. She goes, 'What gives you the right to do jokes about black people like that?' I'm like, 'Listen, lady, my best friend is Cuban and that's close enough.'
===
Something always happens to let you know you're back in New York -- like the way people order in a restaurant: 'Could you take my order before Jesus gets back? What's the matter with you? I've evolved into another species here, you understand? I can't eat clam chowder no more. I gotta see the cyborg menu, you understand?'
Have you ever been drunk in the middle of the day? And I don't mean a couple of cocktails with lunch -- I mean like severely messed up. It's weird because you can't even properly relate to people anymore. I was like, 'What do you mean I can't get an Egg McMuffin? What -- because it's after 11? That's ridiculous.' He's like, 'No, sir, because this is a bank.'
===
Did you hear about the guy they found dead with his head in his cornflakes?The police thought it was a cereal killer.

===
It's the hand job of cereals 'cause it's like, 'This is pretty good, but you know what I really want.'
My friend said, 'Try lamb skin. They're really thin. Lamb skin condoms, they're good.' And they are. What he didn't tell me was that right when you begin to conduct business, the whole room smells like a gyro. We were doing our thing. She said, 'What's that?' I said, 'I don't know, but I'm getting hungry,'
===
The bill is clearly on my side of the table. It was as far as it could be on my side of the table without falling over. It was like she was playing table football, and she won.
I didn't even see the salmon on the menu because the salmon was on the section of the menu I wouldn't allow my eyes to look at. People, you know you get a menu, there's a whole page that's not your page.
===
I know who wasn't black -- I don't care what nobody say -- Noah was not black. Noah and his family couldn't have been black 'cause there's no way no black family was on no boat for 40 days and 40 nights and didn't eat them two chickens.
Have you been eating cake lately? You look a little crumby.

After an elderly couple starts getting forgetful, they visit their doctor. Their doctor tells them that many people find it useful to write themselves little notes.When they get home, the wife says, "Dear, will you please go to the kitchen and get me a dish of ice cream? And maybe write that down so you won't forget?""Nonsense," says the husband. "I can remember a dish of ice cream.""Well, I'd also like some strawberries and whipped cream on it," the wife replies."My memory's not all that bad," says the husband. "No problem -- a dish of ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream. I don't need to write it down."He goes into the kitchen, and his wife hears pots and pans banging.  The husband finally emerges from the kitchen and presents his wife with a plate of bacon and eggs.She looks at the plate and asks, "Hey, where's the toast I asked for?" 
Holding my nephew, I realized I'm getting older, and that's a very strange feeling. And I don't mind it 'cause now the simplest things in life make me really happy. I'm telling you, if I have a new box of breakfast cereal in the cupboard in the kitchen, I get up about 20 minutes early in the morning. I mean, I'm really excited. I march in there, rip it open, jam my hand right to the bottom of the box looking for the prize -- 'cause when you're an adult, you don't have to wait.
===
"I despise you for being different from me."
I'll walk up to a woman, I'll say the first thing that comes to mind: 'Hey, you hungry?'
===
I was in the supermarket, and I had these two shopping carts full of groceries, and I was waiting in line. This guy got in line behind me, and all he had was a jar of spaghetti sauce and some spaghetti. He kept checking his watch and looking at my two full carts, trying to hint for me to let him go ahead of me. I just totally ignored him, but then finally, I turned around. I said, 'Hey man, if that's all you have is that spaghetti sauce and that spaghetti, then you should just go ahead and do some more shopping because I'm going to be a while.'
I'm an old school, hardcore political activist. For instance, I still won't eat grapes because of the plight of the migrant farm workers. I also won't eat raisins because of the older migrant farm workers. That's how hardcore I am. I also won't eat prunes. That's for a completely different reason.

I can bring you to a full boil!
I'll have you saying, "My compliments to the chef" in no time!

We can get as crudite as you want, baby.

I have two rules when you come to my house on Halloween. Wear a costume -- 'cause if you've manned your door at your own house, you know how many kids will roll up, 14 years old with no costume and an attitude. My other rule: don't grab. Let me assess you and then design a candy situation for you.
Edible underwear? Even during sex, we can't stop eating.
===
Whenever I eat at a restaurant I never put the napkin in my lap. People say, 'Hannibal, why don't you put the napkin in your lap?' Because I believe in myself. I believe in my ability to not spill food in my pants 'cause I'm a g**damn adult. And I've mastered the art of getting food from my plate to my mouth without messing up my jeans. You need to believe in yourself, too and get your life together, that's for babies. Have some confidence in your eating abilities and hand/eye coordination.
I don't like when people say, 'I'll pray for you. I'm going to pray for you. Praying for you.' You're going to pray for me? So you're going to sit at home and do nothing? 'Cause that's what your prayers are; you doing nothing while I struggle with a situation. Don't pray for me -- make me a sandwich or something.
===
I love chocolate. Here's why I love chocolate so much. You see, in this country, a person is assumed to be white unless otherwise specified. That's why I like chocolate. Because when you first think of chocolate, you think of something brown. And if you think of white chocolate first, well, then you're a racist.
Vegans don't use animal products in their food, and that's a key part of soul food. That is an essential part of soul food: animal products. Therefore, vegan soul food is essentially a heavy metal cover album of Motown classics.
===
Why did we need white chocolate to begin with? What was wrong with chocolate? It's chocolate, it's great. Why did we need to make white chocolate? Do you love the taste of chocolate but can't stand looking at it? Well, try some white chocolate -- it's from the people that brought you white Jesus.
I came up with a barbecue recipe I want you all to try. Real easy to prepare, here's what you do: go over to your grocery store, pick yourself up some cow tongue, some bacon and some lovely, lovely freshly cut flank steak. It's my own recipe, friends. I call it, 'Lick My Greasy Ass.'
===
Did you ever notice at the drive-thru they always got that little sign: 'No vehicle, no service'? So this is what I did: I bought myself a Wonder Woman costume. So now, I walk right up to the window. The lady says, 'Where's your vehicle?' I say, 'I'm in my invisible jet, a**hole.'

I was at my first Hollywood party, trying to fit in, trying not to sweat. And this woman who I just met comes up to me and says, 'Hey, Jackie, there's cake. Of course you'll want a piece of cake.' Wow, no thank you. Cake is not my downfall. I am not retaining excess cake. You got a piece of chicken back there -- I'm all over it.
The Chinese food in China is not better than the Chinese food here, mostly because of differences of definitions of words that we have -- like, for example, 'beef.'
===
I'm like, 'Hey, Phil, this is pretty good pizza'. He's like, 'Pft. It's not like a piece of New York pizza. You wanna call that piece of cracker with some cheese and some tomato juice on it a piece of pizza, go 'head. In New York, we got pieces of pizza a foot wide, five inches thick, whole tomatoes on top, cheese so thick it gives you a heart attack right in your heart -- and you enjoy having that heart attack because it's from New York.'
Think about this: that Eucharist is the body of Christ, the son of God, the creator of the whole universe. Don't you think he could have just a little more flavor?

There is a baseball park in Illinois that is serving what is called 'Baseball's Best Burger.' This is a giant burger. It's smothered in cheese, covered in bacon and served between two Krispy Kreme glazed donuts, and it doesn't stop there. For an extra 50 cents, you can actually have a cardiologist pop out and just punch you.
Everyone said to me the same thing when I gained all my weight, they were like, 'Well, it's just 'cause you got married, you're a newlywed and you're happy, that's why you gained the weight.' And I was like, 'Oh, I thought I gained the weight because every night I sit in front of the TV eating a block of cheese with my bare hands like it's a sandwich.'
===
The only tradition I feel that we need to reconsider is at that holiday, Jews give each other these little chocolate coins covered in gold foil. And I just feel like when your people is demonized for being obsessed with cash, you should not be seen gobbling money. And they always come in these little yellow fishnets, you know, like we just caught them fresh from our ocean of wealth. You should not be seen eating your stereotype. Like, you don't see Asian people eating chocolate math problems. You don't see Mexican people eating, like, chocolate uninsured cars, you don't see lesbians eating chocolate WNBA games.
Have you seen the bologna that has the olives in it? Who's that for? 'I like my bologna like a martini. With an olive.' 'I'll have the bologna sandwich -- dirty.'
===
When you don't drink, people always need to know why. They're like, 'You don't drink? Why?' This never happens with anything else. 'You don't use mayonnaise? Why? Are you addicted to mayonnaise? Is it OK if I use mayonnaise?'
If you eat a lot of spicy food, you can damage your sense of taste. When I was in Mexico last year, I was listening to a lot of Michael Bolton.
===
I was at the doctor this week. He says, 'Joe, you should really try and be the perfect weight.' So I looked behind him on the chart, and it turns out, I'm still within the parameters of being the perfect weight. Apparently, I'm the wrong height.
I don't want to lose weight. My tongue and my taste buds are the only friends I got.
===
He wakes up, and he wants a cookie for breakfast. He knows she's going to say no. So, he comes to me at six o'clock in the morning. You're an intelligent man. If somebody looks at you at six o'clock in the morning and goes, 'I want a cookieee!', what do you do? You give him the cookie. He could've asked for crack; I would've said, 'Come over here with the pipe. Let's get high and watch "Rugrats" together.'
I didn't know I was making Thanksgiving dinner for you on a bun. It's a sandwich, alright? It's not a nuclear war situation. You're gonna eat again in three hours, dude.

Denny's has a slogan, 'If it's your birthday, the meal is on us.' If you're in Denny's and it's your birthday, your life sucks.
You're probably aware that Britain stopped evolving gastronomically around the year 1242.
===
With Chinese food, you get hungry again. Why is that? It's a different kind of hunger. You go from food to starving -- nothing in between. You go, 'Oh my God, I can't believe I ate all that chow mein -- hey, look! They brought egg rolls!'
I like shopping at health food stores. If you want to know where the gluten-free stuff is, look for the gentleman with a gun in his mouth -- 'cause bullets are gluten-free.
===
I read a caption in the paper the other day. The caption read, 'In the time it takes you to finish reading this sentence, 20 people will have died of hunger.' How the hell do they know how fast I can read? I had to read it again. I killed 40 f**king people.
I've been trying to write a joke about how hard it would be to hide from the Nazis if I had just eaten Mexican food. And I know I want the punch line to be 'The Diarrhea of Anne Frank.'
===
I like sushi. I just deep fry it first. I drink moonshine martinis. They're delicious. I got a hybrid, I put a gun rack in it, dude.
Quick tip: posting pictures on Facebook of food does not make you a foodie; it makes you unfriendable on Facebook.
===
I played clarinet in the marching band and I was fat, which was horrible because we used to sell these candy bars for the band so we could go on band trips at the end of the year. They would give us a huge box of candy bars at the beginning of the week. At the end of the week, I was like, 'Ma, look, yeah, can I have $50 bucks?'
I work with some women who are really skinny -- really really skinny. They have this thing called 'salad time.' There's a leader. 'Salad time,' she'll say to the other ones, and they all get up and walk with her. They go get salads and bring them back and then discuss who's healthiest. They're like... 'Crunchy Chinese noodles -- what a fun, crunchy treat.' Screw you both. Doritos are a fun, crunchy treat.

In my heart of hearts, I hope that somewhere in this world there really is a geographic location known as Cheddar Bay. Somewhere, maybe north of Nova Scotia, where the sailors can guide their weary vessels into the cheesy waves, and the salty fog'll hit 'em, and they'll all be carrying treasures and necklaces for their port lover by the name of Brandy.
I was a stripper -- in Russia. It's a little different standard over there. It's cool 'cause they put bread in your g-string -- beats waiting in line.
===
I think the holidays are important because that's when you go home and do some alcoholic drinking and compulsive overeating with your dysfunctional families.
Hear about the new sushi bar that caters exclusively to lawyers?
===
I love that vegans are the only people you're allowed to make fun of nowadays. Even vegetarians are like, 'Pft! Stupid vegans. Why don't you eat some milk and eggs, you pussies?'
The worst thing about Halloween is, of course, candy corn. Candy corn is the only candy in the history of America that's never been advertised. And there's a reason -- all of the candy corn that was ever made was made in 1911.
===
For as long as I can remember, I've had an eating disorder: reverse anorexia. It's when I look in the mirror and think I'm really skinny.
Out in L.A., when girls are hungry, they're like, 'Oh my God, I'm, like, really hungry. I could, like, totally go for, like, a tofu brussels sprout lettuce wrap.' I'm from Ohio. When I'm hungry, I'm like, 'I can really go for some cow right now, just a whole f**king cow.'
===
My roommate is this completely psychotic, anal retentive nightmare roommate. He's the kind of guy who will eat bran on the toilet. He's insane. Why even eat the bran? Why don't you just buy the bran, throw it in your toilet and alleviate the middle man?
What should we expect from a compassionate conservative?... Which part of the compassionate conservative equation is it that steals from poor kids' lunch programs to pay for tax cuts for the rich? I'm not sure.
===
The lady was at the Mexican restaurant, saw the image of Christ on a flour tortilla. Christ is not coming back at Taco Bell, y'all. I'm sorry.
I like Condoleezza Rice. She's a smart woman. She knows four or five languages. Plus, her name sounds like a side dish at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
===
Ladies, if a guy ever tells you he wants to cover you from head to toe in honey and lick it off inch by inch, that's a man who's never done it before.
I like to go to fast food restaurants and order stuff they don't have. Got to try that. Go to Burger King or something -- 'Hey, Burger King! Have it my way, huh? Woo! Look at that menu... Ah, let me have the catfish dinner with brussel sprouts, two biscuits and a Coors Light.'
===
Manhattan children are like weird, uppity little pod children. Did you ever notice that? They're like a little too sophisticated, a little snotty. My friend had me babysit one of her kids. It was, like, a little six-year-old, I guess -- I don't know, it was walking and talking -- whatever age that happens, I don't know. Anyway, I was watching the little kid, and I asked her what her favorite food was. I was trying to make conversation -- what do you talk to them about? And I said, 'What's your favorite food?' And she said, 'Udon noodles.' Try 'chicken nugget,' you little freak, like the rest of the country.
She actually asked me for four grapes once. She counted grapes. What kind of mental patient counts grapes? Do you know anyone who does that? That's the weirdest thing. I was like, 'Four grapes...' To me grapes aren't even a food. They're like a palate cleanser. That's what I eat to get the Big Mac taste out of my mouth.
===
How complicated can ice cream flavors be? How much can you put in there? I mean, when the flavor's something like banana ice cream with caramel, fudge chunks, cheddar goldfish and pennies -- you've got to draw a line there.
Thirty ways to shape up for summer -- number one: eat less; number two: exercise more; number three... What was I talking about? I'm so hungry right now.
===
Food is so fancy now. All the restaurants have to tell you what's going to happen to the food. 'Oh, we're going to terrify the beef. Then we're going to shove it up next to some carrots that don't know what's up. They're going to try to escape but there's a tsunami of booze juice coming at 'em!' It's like, I don't need to know all that, all I need to know is, does that shape fit in here? How do I get that little gentleman into the munching cave?
Harlem has actually changed, like, you guys, you can go. There are white people in Harlem, and you can tell, 'cause we got, like, three Starbucks, salad -- white people bring salad, that's nice. The first time I saw a ripe tomato, I was like, 'Oooh, they coming.'
===
I went to a fashion show. Models are wearing $10,000 worth of stuff, $15,000 shoes -- and mad! You know why they mad? Because they hungry, that's why.
There are some people that are not fun people to go out and eat with. There's a type of person, wherever you go out, they want a bite of whatever you have. You know who you are. And they always lie, like, 'What is that? I've never had that before. No, I swear to God, I never had that. Give me a bite of that would you? What is that? A ham-burger? I've heard of that. Give me half of that.'
===
I have unfortunately developed a medical condition. I don't know if any of you people have ever heard of it, it's called 'office ass.' You get it from sitting on your ass and eating M&Ms; all day. It's at a pretty advanced stage right now. So, I looked in our benefits brochure to see if they cover, and they don't, which I just find so rude because I definitely got it at work.
Recently they had a Cadbury cream egg-eating competition. The winner, the guy that took the belt, he ate, like -- it was amazing -- he got through, like, half of one. Those things are f**king disgusting. That's the worst thing you can have in your mouth besides a hobo's thumb.

It was easy, man. I just cut out bed calzones. It's all you got to do. Stop taking a hot calzone to bed with you and shot gunning it and drift off to heartburn-fueled nightmarish sleep. Just stop doing that.

I would rather date an anorexic woman than a bulimic woman. OK, now hear me out -- an anorexic woman, although sickly and disgusting looking, I don't have to buy her dinner.
I ended up sleeping with that vegan lady. Sex with the vegan lady, thank you very much. Just for fun I used a lambskin condom. I'm just kidding, I don't use condoms.
===
I went to Dunkin' Donuts last week, and the person waiting on me didn't speak any English at all, like, no words. And it's like I'm all for the melting pot theory, but if I lived in Portugal and I worked at Dunkino Donutos, I might pick up a few keywords, you know, like donutos, munchkinos, chocolatto, coverato. The customers would be like, 'Blah, blah, blah, donutos.' And I'd be like, 'Right away, sir.'
Sex and pizza, they say, are similar. When it's good, it's good. When it's bad, you get it on your shirt.
===
I worked at McDonalds for seven years.... I said I was going to be there for a few months, I ended up being there for seven years, so it really was my Vietnam. And if you're wondering how I can compare working at McDonalds to Vietnam, it's 'cause you weren't fucking there, man!
I'm a little nervous after what happened recently in Mexico: a sewer pipe exploded and killed 200 people. That's what happens when you have an entire country eating Mexican food.
===
I bought a doughnut, and they gave me a receipt for the doughnut. I don't need a receipt for a doughnut. I'll just give you the money, you give me the doughnut -- end of transaction. We don't need to bring ink and paper into this.
I wanted to buy a candle holder, but the store didn't have one. So, I got a cake.

I get up in the morning, I make myself a bowl of instant oatmeal, and then I don't do anything for an hour, which makes me wonder why I need the instant oatmeal. I could get the regular oatmeal and feel productive.

One time I opened up a yogurt, and underneath the lid, it said, 'Please try again.' They were having a contest I was unaware of, but I thought I might have opened the yogurt wrong. Or maybe Yoplait was trying to inspire me? 'C'mon, Mitch. Don't give up. Please try again,' a message of inspiration from your friends at Yoplait. Fruit on the bottom, hope on top.
I think Pringles' initial intention was to make tennis balls, but on the day that the rubber was supposed to show up, a big truckload of potatoes arrived. And Pringles is a laid-back company -- they said, 'F**k it. Cut 'em up.'

There were two muffins sitting in an oven. The first muffin looked at the second muffin and said, "Man, it's getting hot in here!"    Then the second muffin looked at the first muffin."Oh my God! A talking muffin!"

I used to be a dork, back when I had different glasses. These are kicking, obviously.... There's no metal in them, so I can fight Magneto -- you're welcome. I'm also a vegetarian, means not a lot of iron in my system. Strike two, Magneto: can't control my blood. One too many Magneto jokes per usual.
Bragging to me you had sex with a prostitute is like bragging that you got some chips from a vending machine.

I'm in a hotel room, it's four in the morning, and I have no silverware -- you ever try to eat an uncut pizza? It's like an 80-pound Ritz cracker, you know? I had third degree burns on my face and titties by the time I was done eating this thing.
===
It's great working there, because you get free diarrhea.
Pizza for a meal? Four slices for me. Because that's what a meal is -- three slices to get full and that one more because I'm worth it.

If I ever commit suicide, here's what I plan to do -- you can use this -- I'm gonna fling myself off the top of a skyscraper, but before I do, I'm gonna stuff my pockets with candy and gum. That way, when I smack into the sidewalk, I'll burst like this big, human pinata. That way, the on-lookers who walk up, they can go, 'Oh man, he really must have been depressed -- oh, Snickers! Alright!'
People get self-conscious about the way they look, but here's the thing you gotta do: change the perspective. Think about it. Whenever I feel bad about the way I look, I consider that, on a daily basis, all I ate is fried meat, about half a case of beer and a carton of cigarettes. So, then, I should look a lot worse.
===
I get peanuts on every flight. I'm on a plane -- all of a sudden, I gotta have peanuts? I go for months at a time without eating a peanut. What makes them think, 'We're in the air! Get them peanuts! Hurry!'?

I picture the Burger King king -- that's my God. You can have your God, I got my God. He's got the unmoving smiling face, the crown, the Whopper Jr. and he's up there watching. Just like, 'You wanna live? Have it your way.'
I've been talking about not liking certain movies, and I've been getting heckled.... If you go to Burger King and eat that little Oreo cake, and you're like, 'this tastes like crap,' the chef doesn't come out like, 'Hey! You make a cake! You wanna talk about cake, come back when you're up to here in yeast! Talking about cake is for cake-makers only! You wanna talk about cake, get makin' cakes!' I don't have to make a cake to know that Charlie St. Cloud was horrible.
===
They have like 300 or 400 signs on the highway to try and get you to come to this attraction. And they have a million different ones and they say different things like, 'Wall Drug: Free ice water.' Tells you about the caliber of attraction we're dealing with. That wasn't even the best one, the best one said, 'Wall Drug: Free doughnut for Vietnam veterans.' Yeah. Couple things about that. One: doughnut -- singular. 'Take it easy lieutenant, maybe move on to the ice water.' I also just love the idea of a guy holding a glazed, being like, 'You know, it was all worth it.'
How did Dairy Queen get pregnant?

We do have something in common in that tonight neither one of us will be having meat.

Hello! Welcome to "Cooking That Has Nothing To Do With Anyone's Actual Life." Today we're making a very complicated recipe, using ingredients you don't have, utensils you've never heard of, in a kitchen bigger than your whole bloody house!'
===
We have so many nationalities. It's gotten to the point now that you can go into any fast food place, and you can find out what kind of neighborhood you're in just by the ethnic group that works there. It's like, if Chinese people work there, you're in a Chinese neighborhood; if black people work there, you're in a black neighborhood; if white people work there, then you're in Utah.
Let's see -- the cheese doesn't have enough fat; let's give it a cholesterol jacuzzi.
===
I went to the store; I'm on the cereal aisle where they have the cereal, and I see a box of Cap'n Crunch. It's just the crunch berries; there's no crunch -- it's just a box of crunch berries. And that is the problem with kids today, right there: they don't have to work for nothin'. When I was a kid, you had to eat around the berries for half an hour, and then you had a berry finale at the end. You had a berry surprise, and you earned it, and it built character.
I love the dessert menu there, too, because it's so ridiculous. They actually take a color photo of the dessert, which is unnecessary. It's a photo like it had its own photo shoot day. It's almost a fat guy porno mag at that point.
===
People are so backwards in Hollywood. Like, they take drugs right out in the open, but they eat in the closet.
Models can't eat at all. They live off air and hairspray.

I don't eat right. I had cheese sticks for dinner tonight. It'd be healthier to take a bullet. At least a bullet would go through you.
How do you find Ronald McDonald in a nudist colony?
===
We've all had that night, where you wake up, kinda like a werewolf does in his cave after a rampage: 'What did I do last night?' There's just animal carcasses all over the place. But for me, it's like, I open my eyes, and I look to my left, and there's a 7-11 hot dog wrapper. 'Nooooo! Dear God no! Oh my God -- SpaghettiOs, with the spoon in the can! Gah! I didn't even heat it up! The devil was in my bones last night!'
She says, 'The way you're acting is the reason Europeans hate Americans.' And this is what I said -- true story -- 'Do you know where you are right now? Because you're in McDonald's. This is American soil. You might as well be at the f**king embassy. You might as well be at the embassy, sweetheart, 'cause nobody tells me how to act in McDonald's.'

We are the fattest nation on the planet. You know we're obsessed with food when we come up with something called cotton candy. Who was so hungry they thought, 'I wish I could eat my clothes'?
I had friends in high school that used to do speed. Actually, they used to take diet pills, cheap speed, and they talked me into trying it one time. They're like, 'You won't want to eat anything.' Didn't have that affect on me at all -- I just ate really fast.
===
She says to me, 'When I go on road trips, I like to eat only at Denny's and analogues of Denny's.' Now, 'analogue,' if you don't know, means 'the same as.' I had no idea. In fact, I'm so unused to hearing the word 'analogue' that I thought she said 'anagram,' and I spent the next 15 minutes trying to think of the name of the restaurant that had all the letters of Denny's in it arranged differently.
Today I found out I am broke... I don't want a lot, I just want a little to afford those finer things in life I see other folks have -- you know, like food.

Push it!
Friends of mine freak out when I tell them I'm a good cook... Why would you be that surprised that I can cook? I'm a big boy. I can cook. It kind of goes hand-in-hand. You should be that surprised if I tell you something like, I don't know, I teach aerobics.

Some people hate bad waiters; I don't mind them. My mother, though, she'll tip a bad waiter a condom so he won't reproduce.

Two eggs were kissing on a bed when the female egg said, "I have to go change. I'll be back in a minute."Five minutes later, the the female egg walked out in a slinky 'egg'lige, rubbing her hands up and down her smooth, oval-shaped body.Instantly, the male egg slapped his hands on the top of his head, covering it completely."What are you doing?," the female egg asked.He replied, "The last time I was this hard, someone cracked me on the head with a spoon."
Guys now, they're supposed to drink a lot of pineapple juice for the ladies. It's supposed to make the old BJ's a little more palatable. I wonder how much they paid those taste testers. Kind of sounds like a myth, doesn't it? That was created by the people at Dole.
===
I found a restaurant at this ballpark; the restaurant was called Crazy Crab'z. How do you simultaneously disregard and comply with grammar? We all know you substitute the 'z' for the 's,' you make that word more hip, more edgy. But for clarification, that edginess is not plural, it's possessive. Apparently you don't come here to eat a whole lot of crabs, you come here because this one crazy ass crab that owns this joint. He's nuts. He don't even serve seafood -- it's Crazy Crab'z House of Prime Rib.
I got a lot of friends that are starting to get married. It's weird 'cause a lot of my female friends, I think they are progressive, liberal minded folks but when it comes to the engagement ring they want a traditional, big ass rock. I understand ladies love diamonds because diamonds are forever, true, but so is a plastic bag. 'Because my love is eternal, because my love will never break down -- I want to give you this non-biodegradable grocery sack. Don't be sad, girl, it's got like 50 carrots in there.'

I made a casserole last week. The only trouble is when I wanted to take it out of the oven, I realized I don't even own any oven mitts. But luckily, since I'm a sports fan, I had a couple of those #1 foam hands, which makes your casserole presentation oh so much more dramatic.

A newspaper reporter went to interview an old man who was the last person in the county to have   lived through the Civil War.  Thinking he had a story, the reporter started asking some questions.  "Sir, you have lived through the civil war and two world wars.  You have seen the invention of the automobile and the airplane.  In all of your days, what would you say is the single most interesting thing you have seen in all of your days?"The man replied, "The Thermos."Puzzled, the reporter asked, "Why?""Well," the old man responded, "when you put something hot in it, it keeps it hot.  When you   put something cold in it, it keeps it cold...  HOW DOES IT KNOW?"

One of the things in there is this toaster that toasts hot dogs and hot dog buns, specifically. It just seems like the kind of person that's eating that many hot dogs in their diet probably ain't gonna have that kind of cash to kick down. They're not even on that flight.
===
I made myself a good dinner tonight. I used a wok. That is a great thing to have. With a wok, in the privacy of your own home, you can create your own mediocre Chinese food for 50 cents less than ordering take-out. I'm standing over this thing, going, 'Oh yeah, I'm glad I'm making this stuff myself. Those restaurants in Chinatown just don't make hot dog fried rice the way I like it.'

Here's a tip for all the weed smokers in the room. If you're going to smoke, always smoke with your fat friends -- the fatter the better. 'Cause your fat friends will take the munchies to a whole other level. Your fat friends are like, 'Damn, potato chips? I'm gonna go bake a cake.'
I like the fairy tales. Some of them don't fit, though, like 'The Three Bears.' That's not cool because it wouldn't work with a different person in it besides Goldilocks... 'Cause Goldilocks, she breaks into these people's houses. I mean, she comes into the bears' house -- she walks into the yard, into the house. Then, she's in the house; she's eating their porridge. She's like, 'Ew, this is too hot.' Bitch, this ain't your food!

A truck driver stopped at a roadside diner for lunch and ordered a cheeseburger, coffee and a slice of apple pie. As he was about to eat, three bikers walked in.One grabbed the trucker's cheeseburger and took a huge bite from it. The second one drank the trucker's coffee, and the third wolfed down his apple pie. The truck driver didn't say a word as he paid the waitress and left.As the waitress walked up, one of the motorcyclists growled, "He ain't much of a man, is he?""He's not much of a driver, either," the waitress replied. "He just backed his 18-wheeler over three motorcycles."

I have nephews. They love spending time with us. T they love it because we let them do whatever they want to do -- they're not our kids, we don't care. 'Only thing I have to do is keep you alive, that's it.' They come visit us, man -- 'Oh what? Oh, no dinner? Alright, fine, hey -- ice cream all day, how about that? I don't have to cook a damn thing. Just scoop it out. There you go. Eat up. I don't pay your dental bills.' 
I enjoy the fast food, I'll tell you that right now. My favorite of all the fast food restaurants -- it might be a little surprising -- the Bell, Taco Bell. I like the Bell for a couple of reasons: 1) the beautiful dining room; 2) I feel very wealthy ordering food at that restaurant.

She stomped her foot and went back inside. The man thought ''how weird.''A few minutes passed and sure enough, the blonde came out of her house again, checked her mail box, stamped her foot and went back inside. The man stopped mowing and checked her mailbox to see what was so wrong with it. After seeing nothing, he went back to mowing just shrugging his shoulders.As soon as he heard her coming out again, he shut off his mowing machine and went up to her. ''What in the world are you doing, coming out here every five minutes?''The blonde looked up at the man and said, ''Well, you see, there's this little voice in my house that keeps on saying, 'You've got mail,' but when I come out here to check, I don't have any.''

    Dear Son,    I'm writing this slow 'cause I know youcan't read fast.  We don't live where we did when you left.  Your dad read inthe paper that most accidents happen within twenty miles of home, so we moved. Won't beable to send you the address as the last Arkansas family that lived here took the numberswith them for their house, so they wouldn't have to change their address.    This place has a washing machine. The first day I put four shirts in it, pulled the chain and haven't seen 'em since.    It only rained twice this week, threedays the first time and four days the second time.    The coat you wanted me to send to you,Aunt Sue said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail with them heavy buttons,so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.    We got a bill from the funeral home, andit said if we didn't make the final payment on Grandma's funderal bill, up she comes.    About your sister, she had a baby thismorning.  I haven't found out whether if it is a boy or a girl so don't know if youare an Aunt or Uncle.    Your Uncle John fell in the whiskeyvat.  Some men tried to get him out, but he fought them off playfully, so hedrowned.  We cremated him and he burned for three days.    Three of your friends went off thebridge in a pickup.  One was driving and the other two were in the back.  Thedriver got out.  He rolled down the window and swam to safery.  The other 2drowned.  They couldn't get the tail gate down.    Not much more news this time. Nothing much happened.  If you don't get this letter, please let me know and I willsend another one.Love, Ma

Two airplane mechanics named Bob and Tim work at Atlanta airport.  Atlanta gets fogged in one night and nothing can take off or land so Bob and Tim have nothing to do.  After work Bob and Tim usally have a drink on their way home, so Bob says to Tim, I heard that you can get a buzz off drinking jet fuel.  Since they have nothing better to do, they try it.  Finally, their shift is over and they get to go home.  Next morning Bob calls Tim and says, How are you feeling?  Tim says he's fine, never felt better. Bob asks, Do you have a hangover?  Tim says no.  Then Tim says, Wow this is great!  We can drink all we want and not get a hangover.  Then Bob says, Well, there is one side effect, Tim.  Have you farted yet?  Tim says, No, why?Bob says, I'm calling you from Detroit!

All good Southerners already know these, but in fairness  to those Yankees who were dumb enough to stay down here:1.  Don't order a steak at a Waffle House. They serve breakfast 24 hrs a day, so let them cook something they know.2.  Don't laugh at people's names. Merleen, Bodie, Luther Ray, Tammy Ann, Mari Beth, and Inez have all been known to whip a man's ass for less than that.3.  Don't order a bottle of pop or a can of soda -- this can lead to a merciless beating. Down South it's called Coke, even if you want a Pepsi.4.  Don't show allegiances to any college football squad that isn't an SEC team. All the others are a bunch of candy asses who get to play Wyoming every week.5.  Don't refer to Southerner's as a bunch of hillbillies. Many of us are/have been more literate than you (e.g. Welty, Williams, Faulkner), better educated, and generally much nicer to boot.  We've got plenty of business sense (e.g.Turner Broadcasting, MCI WorldCom, MTV, and Netscape). Naturally, we can have lapses of judgment from time to time (e.g. Clinton, Fordice, Duke). We don't care if you think we're dumb, we know better!6.  We are fully aware that the humidity is high. Quit your bitching, spend your money, and leave.7.  Don't order wheat toast at the Cracker Barrel. If you do this, everyone will know you're from Ohio. Eat the biscuits like God intended and for goodness sake, don't put sugar in your grits.   8.  Don't attempt to fake a Southern accent.  Nothing will incite a riot faster.9.  Don't go around talking about how much better it is back home.  If you don't like it here, take your Yankee ass back home.10. We don't play lacrosse, hockey or any of those other sissy ass Northern games, so don't ask about the scores. We...simply...don't...care.11. We know how to speak proper English, we talk this way because we want to and we can. It's like playing jazz, you have to know how to do it right first.12. Last, but by no means least...DO NOT try to tell us how to Bar-B-Q. This could lead to permanent expulsion and revocation of your work visa.    Consider yourself just damn lucky that we let you come down here in the first place. Don't push your luck!

Go figure.The rules of the contest required each finalist to compose a four-line poem  in one minute or less, and the poem had to contain the word Timbuktu.The San Francisco State graduate went first. About thirty seconds  after the clock started he jumped up and recited the following poem:'Slowly across the desert sandTrekked the dusty caravan.Men on camels, two by twoDestination -- Timbuktu.The audience went wild! How, they wondered if the redneck could top that?!    The clock started again and the redneck sat in silent thought.  Finally, in the last few seconds, he jumped and recited:Tim and me, a-huntin' went.Met three whores in a pop-up tent.They was three, we was two,So I bucked one and Timbuktu

As they entered their late teens the girls dated, and on this particular evening all three of his girls were going out on a date. This was the first time this had occurred.

On a rainy night, three guys were driving through the countryside. Their car broke down, so they went to a nearby farm.

A pilot was forced to make a crash landing in a farmer's field.  The farmer took the pilot back   to the farmhouse, where the pilot noticed the farmer had a golden fiddle hanging above the   fireplace.  The two men were standing there talking when the farmer's wife came down the   steps.  The pilot couldn't believe how beautiful she was."How can you   trust her to be here by herself all day, while you go out and work the fields?""I trust my wife," the farmer said. "She's never been unfaithful.""I'll make you a little bet.  If I take your wife upstairs, she'll be unfaithful.  If not, you can have my plane.    But, if she is, I get your fiddle.""It's a deal."   So, the pilot and the farmer's wife go upstairs.  About a half hour passes, and the farmer picks up the fiddle and starts playing it."Be true to me, Be true to me, Be true for just one hour.  Be true to me, Be true to me,  And his   airplane will be ours."  Another fifteen minutes pass, and suddenly he sees his wife coming down the stairs.  He asks her if she stayed true to him.  She walked over, picked up the fiddle, started playing it."He kissed me on the lips, He kissed me on the tits, He kissed me in the middle. He kissed a spot that you forgot, and you lost your fucking fiddle."

After some careful thought, he came up with a clever idea that he thought would scare the kids away for sure.He made up a sign and posted it in the field. The next night, the kids showed up and they saw the sign which read, "Warning! One of the watermelons in this field has been injected with cyanide."The kids ran off, made up their own sign and posted it next to the farmer's sign. When the farmer returned, he surveyed the field. He noticed that no watermelons were missing, but the sign next to his read, "Now there are two!"

One day a traveling salesman was driving down a back country road at about 30 mph when he noticed that there was a three-legged chicken running alongside his car.He stepped on the gas but at 50 miles per hour. The chicken was still keeping up. After about a mile of running the chicken ran up a farm lane and into a barn behind an old farm house.The salesman had some time to kill so he turned around and drove up the farm lane.  He knocked at the door and when the farmer answered he told him what he had just seen.The farmer said that he was a geneticist and had developed this breed of chicken because he, his wife and his son each like a drumstick when they have chicken and this way they only have to kill one chicken."That''s the most fantastic thing I've ever heard," said the salesman. "How do they taste?""I don't know," said the farmer. "We've never caught one."
--If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth eating.-- If you run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in the cab of a four-wheel-drive truck with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help, just stay out of their way -- this is what they live for.-- Don't be surprised to find boiled peanuts, movie rentals and fishing bait in the same store.-- Remember: "Y'all" is singular. "All y'all" is plural. "All y'all's" is plural possessive.-- Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't understand you either.-- If you hear a Southerner exclaim, "Hey, y'all, watch this!" -- stay out of his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say.-- If you see a turn signal blinking on a car with a southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was on when the car was purchased.-- Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. They are to be positioned directly in front of one's trailer, since it cost considerably more than the trailer and should, therefore, be displayed.-- As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph zone, directly in the middle of the road, remember: many Southerners learned to drive on a John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for that vehicle.-- You can ask a Southerner for directions, but unless you already know the positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find it yourself.

Whenever I get down to my last $3, I'd always head to the nearest 7-11 -- the white trash casino -- and I'd buy a 40-ounce of beer and a lottery scratch ticket. I would drink the beer, and I'd scratch the ticket And it'd always be some game with some dream come true name -- you know, like, 'Pot of Gold' or 'Win the Millions' or 'Money Stack' -- and there's a picture of a big stack of money on the ticket. I think a better name for those games would be 'Spend the Child Support.' And what you do is scratch the money from a baby's mouth.

A traveling salesman approached an old farmhouse and noticed the strange behavior of the couple inside. The woman was running the lawn mower over the carpet and the man had one hand dipped in a fish bowl and was playing with himself with the other. The salesman assumed they were crazy and   moved on.After he'd finished his pitch at the next farmhouse, he mentioned what he'd just seen.''Oh, those folks ain't crazy,'' the farmer said,   ''They're both deaf mutes. She was telling him to mow the lawn, and he was telling her to go f**k herself because he was going fishing.''

I was a senior in high school, and some friends of mine and I were driving over to Birmingham, Alabama, about an hour away. We were taking the big road trip over  'cause we wanted to go see KISS in concert -- what white trash story does not start out exactly like that?
I just hear the DJ on the radio in my car; I hear, 'Bob from Charlotte, you're on the line. Bob, what do you have to say?' 'Six!' 'Next caller, Dan.' '14!' This went on for like eight minutes -- it's like some sort of inbred, bastardized bingo's taking place.

Just as they come back into the farmer's house, Rebecca walks in. He tells Rebecca to do the same as they just did, and Rebecca heads off towards the garden.

Then Janet laughs and she gets killed too.So they are floating out of their bodies, and Janet asks Samantha why she died. Samantha said that the thought of sticking a turnip up your ass was just too funny. Samantha then asked Janet why she laughed, Janet said: "I saw Rebecca coming around the corner with a watermelon!"

''Now what is the big thing on the end of the penis   called?''''Why that there is called the head of   the penis.''''I do declare!'' exclaimed the young woman. ''One last question doctor,   what are those two big round things about 12 to 14 inches behind the   head of the penis?''''I'm not sure about your husband, ma'am, but on me,   they're called the cheeks of my ass!''

And, being the sweet, romantic guy that he is, he thought the best way to do this would be to get all coked up and then jump through a window and try to murder me.

The thing I despise about Biggie fans is when they're like, 'Oh man, Biggie was so prolific. 'Cause he knew he was going to die an early death and he rapped about it in his rhymes.'

That's basic probability; I don't know if you've taken statistics.

I miss New York. I miss the subways, believe it or not. So, what I do is I have a tape recording of just the sound of the subway, and every morning, I get up, I go into my closet, I close the door, I put the tape on, and I just hang there with my clothes for a while. Then I turn to my overcoat, and I go, 'No, you shut up, pal, alright?' Then I stab myself a few times, and I feel like I'm home.
Every year for my birthday, she would make me a birthday cake from scratch, and then she would let me lick the egg beaters. And then she would turn them on, and that would hurt my tongue.

I like elderly people, unless they brag about their age. 'Look at me. I'm 94 years old.' 'Well, good, that means you'll be passing away soon.'
I smoke. It's bad for you, I know. Warnings on the package tell you so. That's why I don't mind them, because they are bad. My only problem with the warnings though: very scientific. I think they should also have to be philosophical. The front of the package should go, 'Smoking causes fatal diseases.' And the back I think should have to say, 'But only 5% of the world's population believes death is the end.'

What was the name of the hair salon next to the graveyard?
Curl Up and Dye.

As a single couple, we are no longer able to hang around with married couples 'cause they cannot be in our presence without getting very annoying. It's always like, 'So, when are you guys getting married? Huh? When are you getting married? When are you guys getting married?!' I dunno, you're married -- when are you gonna die? You're already married, death will be next. When are you gonna die?
My grandfather is from Ireland. His name is Florence McCarthy. He moved to New York in 1920. They used to beat him up because his name was Florence. He had to switch his name to Frank. And then this Christmas, he made an announcement -- he goes, 'I'm switching me name back to Florence.' And we beat him up, 'cause it's a dumb name and he's old and weak and it was easy.

The number two cause of death among teenagers in America today are guns. You know the number one cause of death? Not having a gun.
It is the little things in life that are important: a good meal, fresh-fallen snow, the look on a child's face just before you hit him....

One night, God visits a preacher.The preacher has one question, "What is Heaven like?"God replies, "Heaven is like a city. It has the best of everything. For example, the French are the chefs, the Italians are the lovers, the English are the policeman, the Germans are the mechanics, and the Dutch are the politicians.""What is Hell like?" he asks."Well," he sighs, "the French are the mechanics, the Italians are the politicians, the English are the chefs, the Germans are the policemen, and the Dutch are the lovers."

It said, 'War Is Not the Answer.' I disagree. I think war absolutely is the answer. And if you don't agree with me, happy Fourth of July.
You know what happened the last time a group of people said, 'Screw it, we don't care what you think'? They got hung as witches.

Remember the old days? Grandma died -- you brought her in the backyard, and you buried her. Tract housing ruined that.
If the truth be known, I don't hit my children because I really don't think I could hit them a little.

If my dad could see me up here now he'd be very impressed. But you know, I'm sure wherever my dad is now, he would be looking down on us. He's not dead just very condescending.
It's true that there are plenty of video games tiny children should not play. I am a grown up lady, and I need to shoot sh*t.

Some cabs, you get in, and they have no kind of protection, security, at all. I guess they give those to the guys who show up late: 'Maybe a couple of head wounds will teach him some punctuality.'
I am going to be sentenced to the StairMaster ring of Dante's 'Inferno,' where I have to get on a StairMaster, and they're going to tape my feet to the pedals. And I realize that StairMaster time is, in fact, the slowest increment of time known to man. It just hangs there. And the only music I get is Michael Bolton, karaoke-style, from a drunken secretary on margarita night.
===
I think car horns should sound like gunshots 'cause the sound of a horn is not representin' my road rage properly. I've never been angry with someone and had the urge to toot a trumpet.
Violence Awareness Day this week -- anyone celebrating that? I don't even know who knows about that day. Does anyone, like, carry that out? Like, come home: 'Yo, Tina! Hey! I thought I told you to clean these pans, girl! I would smack you if it wasn't Violence Awareness Day! You wait until 12:01!'
===
Bill Gates is so rich he hired cancer to kill Steve Jobs.
I invited Courtney Love but she didn't show up. She told me she's writing her book, it's going to be a 'can't rememoir.' That plot's going to have more holes than Kurt Cobain's garage.

For years I thought Tupac Shakur was a Jewish holiday. 'What are you doing for Tupac Shakur?' 'I don't know is that the one where you don't eat for 24 hours?' 'I think it's the one where you get shot in the face in Las Vegas.'
In honor of the recent death of coach Joe Paterno, I think we should all take 12 years of silence.

Everybody wanted to work for Steve Jobs -- except his pancreas.
I moved here about 13 years ago from Seattle, Washington. I left a city that has a high suicide rate for a city that has a high homicide rate. I guess I'm just not a 'do-it-yourself' kind of person.
===
I refuse to go into that store. And as we're walking by, I see that there's a chalkboard, like a little white board on which some employee has written in big, loopy letters, you know, like, daisies over the I's so girls can read it, and it literally says, 'Don't worry ladies, your husbands called, they said it's OK to come in and buy something.' And I'm just like, 'F**k you, Zales.' It really made me want to go in and buy the most expensive thing that they have, and then just come back the next day with a giant black eye. And just be like, 'You lied, Zales. He didn't call. He wasn't OK with that.'
The band starts playing, and everyone just starts running around and pouncing each other to show how much they like the band. What happened to clapping, man?

They were tired because they had to go every day and clean up the grave, clean up condoms and beer cans and bottles, needles, trash all over the place. That's what's so cool -- when you're getting kicked out for partying, and you've been dead since 1971.
Throwing acid is wrong in some people's eyes.

They would hit us for discipline because we grew up really poor. I don't know if you know this, but poor people beat the sh*t out of each other.
How scary is a bullet to my uncle? Not at all, you know why? I saw him take an 11-inch catheter, the hard way -- you know what I'm saying. 'A bullet? You gonna stick it in my penis? No? Then shoot me. I don't give a crap. How bad could it be?'
===
So, I'm single. It's weird 'cause always knew I was gonna die broke and alone. I just didn't know I was gonna live that way, too.
People come to your yard sale and ask for items they don't even see. Like, I got departments you don't know about or something? 'Where are your drapes? We're looking for drapes; we don't see drapes.' Oh, that's 'cause housewares is on the back porch, I'm sorry. You can stop by customer service at the shed, get a Slushee and a pretzel. 'What's your return policy?' I'll f**king stab you if you come back here.
===
I want to take karate. I've got a friend that's been taking it for six months, which is a really dangerous amount of time to take karate because you get to that false confidence stage. You learn that one move; you think you're Bruce Lee. My friend thinks he's the next action movie hero. If somebody ever jumped out with a gun and tried to mug him, the only thing he could do is go, 'OK, grab my wrist.'
It's important to have a good vocabulary. If I had known the difference between the words 'antidote' and 'anecdote,' one of my good friends would still be living.
===
My favorite on that show was Jerry Orbach. I loved him. Yeah -- he was the best because he always had a funny little one-liner when they found the dead body. They found a teacher lying dead in an alley, and Orbach would be like, 'Huh, looks like school's out.' I always wanted to see an episode where he couldn't think of a clever one -- where they find a guy dead with a Mars Bar in his hand, and Orbach's like, 'Huh, looks like, uh, he won't be going to Mars anytime soon. Get it -- Mars Bar? Ah, screw you guys. Nine times out of 10, they're funny.'
For a British person to enter British Heaven, you basically have to die completely unnoticed without causing too much of a kerfuffle.

You never see any black serial killers. Sure, we've got these gangs; they kill one or two people. But you white people -- you're not happy 'til you got 35, 40 bodies piled up in your basement.
We're not lazy? We invented the drive-by shooting, ladies and gentlemen. We don't have the common decency to beat someone with a stick or our bare hands. We're gonna shoot them -- but guess what? We're not even gonna get out of the car and do it, for God's sake. We're not even gonna stop the car.
===
Riding your bike in New York City is exciting, you know what I mean? Cause you know how you're going to die, you just don't know when.
If I was on a cruise ship and my boy fell in, I'm jumping in without even hesitating. Even if I might die, I don't care. My boy would live the rest of his life knowing that his daddy died saving his life. And I'm good with that. If my wife fell in -- my boy would live the rest of his life knowing that his mommy wasn't a strong swimmer.
===
I always wanted to be a figure skater as a kid, too, that was like my fantasy dream. But whenever I watch it, I think I would have totally done it alone. I don't know how these people have enough control over the tempers to be working with a partner. Because if I worked with some guy for 15 years, and we got to the Olympics, and out of nowhere he just fell -- oh, I'd skate around just to chop off his fingers. I would, and I would not feel bad about that -- ever. 'Now when you're nubbing your cereal spoon in the morning, you can look at that box and remember why we're not on it.'
How many of you know who Jeane Dixon is? You know who she is? You know she predicted everybody's death? John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy -- don't you think this is the bitch who's killing these folks? Check her alibi out.
===
Last Thursday, there's an ambulance outside my house, loading a body in. So, I go up to the cop at the door and say, 'What's going on?' He says, 'Looks like your wife committed suicide.' I'm thinking, 'Oh great. Right before the weekend.' So I go down to the morgue to identify her body, and I spend half the day there browsing. The morgue guy pulls up the tray, pulls back the sheet, and I said, 'Yeah, that's her.' All of a sudden, he starts laughing. I said, 'What's so funny?' Next thing I know, the lights come on, she pops up -- 'Surprise! Happy Birthday!' I couldn't believe I fell for that two years in a row.
My uncle comes up, taps me on the back. He's like, 'Kevin, I just want to let you know whoever did this is going to die tonight.'...I said, 'Cancer did it. It was cancer.' He said, 'Well, you tell Cancer I'm looking for him, and when I find him, I'm going to shoot him in the face -- twice.'
===
One time, she got me so mad, we got into a fist fight. You know how you know when you lost a fight to your woman? When the cops come to your house and ask you do you want to press charges. That's how you know it didn't go as you planned.
You never see the Klan in Manhattan for one important reason -- the city is smart. They don't build lawns to burn the crosses on.
===
I live every day like it's the last day of my life. Every morning I wake up real early, and I spend maybe three hours on the phone making funeral arrangements.
I'm not going to give my organs to anyone unless I meet them first. That's how I live. It's like, 'You want my eyes?' 'Yeah.' 'What do you do for a living -- what are you going to be looking at?' 'I work for Playboy.' 'Oh, s**t -- take them now. Just take one. You take one, I'll keep one, we'll look at the proof sheet like pirates.'
===
I don't want kids 'cause I'm tall. I just always feel like, the first time I lift the kid I'll lift him right into a ceiling fan and decapitate him. I'll be like, 'Honey, I told you I didn't want to lift that little fucker. I told you to keep him low, where nothing's spinning.'
When they're nine years old, they have an attention-seeking constitution that is relentless... Honestly, it makes you want to drive drunk on Halloween. Look at Superman fly!
===
I had a kid who threatened to kill me one year because I gave him an F. Another teacher caught one of my students writing 'Kill Mr. Vallee' in his weekly planner in the section labeled 'Weekly Goals and Objectives.' And the school was freakin' out. They didn't know what to do about it. They kept asking me if I felt threatened, and I'm like, 'Why? This kid hasn't met any goals in his objectives all year.'
People think kids are the only ones that want to get out of class at 3 o'clock every single day. No, no -- go see the teachers on a Friday at 3 o'clock. You'll see teachers stiff-arming kids on the way out to the parking lot.
===
There's a part where Freddy has to choose between killing a white girl and killing a black girl. And Freddy says, 'How sweet, dark meat.' Yeah. There was a collective groan in the audience in the theater as I watched it. People were disappointed in Freddy Krueger. Like, 'We're OK with you murdering children with your needle gloves, but racism.... Now we want Jason to win. Mass-murdering monster, but he's no bigot.'
Slept like a baby last night. I woke up every two hours screaming in the dark and then I sh*t my pants and almost died for, like, no reason whatsoever.
===
I want to be a thug so bad, but I can't 'cause I wear glasses. Isn't that crazy? No one respects my thug-ism because I have astigmatism.
You can't be gangster with astigmatism. And I love grimy music, but I can't be a thug. What am I gonna do -- rob bookstores?
===
Right after the earthquake, my mother calls me up. She goes, 'Why don't you move back home?' I said, 'Well, quite frankly, I'd rather die suddenly in an act of God than have you slowly peck me to death for 45 years.'
The inmate on death row is scheduled to be put to death by firing squad. He doesn't request a last meal or anything special for his last day.As he stands before the firing squad he says, "Actually, music is my life. One thing I would really like would be to sing my favorite song, one whole time through, with no interruptions."The guard nods solemnly and tells him to go ahead.The inmate starts, "One billion bottles of beer on the wall... ."

My grandmother, she passed away at Christmas time. So now, I have this built in sadness, you know, every holiday. 'Cause I'm plagued with the thought of, you know, what she would have given me. What didn't I get to open this year?
I think that talk show themes have finally gone too far. I was watching a show where three people came out and they started talking about their failed attempts at suicide. And after it was over, they flashed a 1-800 number across the screen, so you could call in. And I was so touched that I called, and I voted for the first guy.

How do you get a lawyer down from a tree?
Cut the rope.

How many lawyers does it take to build a wall?
Depends on how deep you stack them.

Ladies, that's why it's hard for us to find a man: we're too emotional. We're too emotional. We're the only species that would shoot our man six times, and we would go to his funeral and be like, 'Why! Why'd he make me shoot him?'
I got whupped so much, sometimes I hated to see my mother coming. I'm having fun with my brothers, my sisters, my friends -- my mother pulls up, and I'm thinking, 'Dang! Why she keep coming here? Can't she just drop off the food and stay at work?'
===
I don't understand how some of you women can be abused by a man with a Jheri curl. That don't make no sense, man. All you gotta do is carry a lighter.

The word 'spermicide' sounds like something sperms would do as a last resort. 'I'm not going out there anymore. I can't take it.'
People are too afraid of uptown. A lot of people will tell you, like, 'Don't go to Harlem. You can never go there 'cause as soon as you get there, they kill you.' That's what people think. As soon as you arrive in Harlem, someone just stabs you in the face right away... That's people's image of Harlem: just everyone standing around waiting for lost white people to kill all day.

The gang problem, I think, is in the Middle East. They've been doing drive-bys ever since they found out you could ride a camel and throw a rock at the same time.
There is no way I'm getting my wife a gun because there is no way I'm not getting shot with that gun. Buying my wife a gun is sort of like me saying, 'You know, I kinda want to kill myself, but I want it to be a surprise.'
===
I love fights. Well, I don't like the actual fight; I like the loose change on the floor afterward.
I'll tell you how bad it was in Los Angeles during the riots -- people were actually flooding into Tijuana. That's how bad it was.
===
All the fun of suicide -- without that messy death at the end.
All my friends, we was ready for the second riot. No, not like the first one, where we were just grabbing stuff at random -- it wouldn't be like that. I've got a thousand boxes of Pampers; I don't know what I'm going to do with it. No, no, this time we had a list. We were going to get the stuff we need. Everybody on my block has bought a U-Haul.
===
If you're Catholic you're not supposed to have sex until you get married; which is good I guess if you don't have kids or get diseases. But what happens if you die before you get married, that's not fair. Then you go to heaven a virgin and you might have to have sex with a terrorist.
Why did Mickey Mouse get shot?
===
Hip hop has changed; I get tired of the nonsense, tired of the shoot 'em up song. I hate when mother**kers be like, 'Come to the hood and shoot up your block.' Other people live here. Why you shooting up the whole block? Kevin is the one you got a problem with -- shoot Kevin.
My ex drove me nuts; she was awful. We're watching a television show once, and it was about euthanasia -- you know, mercy killings. And she said, 'Would you do that for me if I was really sick?' I said, 'I'll do that for you if you get the flu. Just let me know.'
===
I don't know if I'm going to Heaven or Hell. I just hope God grades on a curve.
I think it would suck to die, but I think it would be way worse to be immortal. 'Cause think about it, every 50 or 60 years, your wife dies, and you gotta get a new one, and each one has more rights than the last one. 'Hey honey, let's go out and vote.' 'Damn it woman, that used to be my alone time.'
===
Ozzy Osbourne is being sued for $3 million because, apparently, this boy's parents believe their boy was killed due to a song by Ozzy Osbourne, called 'Suicide Solution.' You have to admit -- off the top -- it doesn't look good for Ozzy. I'm sure his agent is going, 'Well, why don't you just call it, "Kill Yourself So Your Parents Can Sue Us"?'
You see all these mafia movies; Italians are always portrayed as angry, violent people. That's not right. As far as we Italians are concerned -- hey, listen, we don't hurt people, but people get hurt, you know? Accidents happen! You walk outside, trip and fall on an ice pick, six or seven times, you know? Right away, they blame Vinny. That's not right.
===
I don't like guns, you know why? It's a killing mechanism. That's all its purpose is; it has no other purpose but to kill. I like a knife better. I pull a knife, you don't know what I'm going to do. Am I going to stab you? Am I going to open a letter? Or am I going to frost a cake? You don't know what I'm going to do. And it's Swiss Army. I can clip my toenails and open a bottle of wine to celebrate all the errands that I got accomplished.
My favorite place to taser people: the Renaissance Fair. The Renaissance Fair 'cause it makes me feel like an evil wizard from the future.
===
I always fire a warning shot before I fire to the target at the shooting range. I fire a warning shot. Now, the people upstairs practicing karate didn't appreciate that.
I knew that I wanted to do comedy when I discovered irony. For those of you who don't know, I actually discovered irony when I was seven, which is when my mom started beating me with my own trophies.
===
On the first day I got there, in my dorm, there's a sign-up -- had a picture of a beer; underneath it, it said: 'A lot of campus rapes start here.' I was like, 'I'm moving out of this dorm. I don't want to live where the rape starts.'
I do try to fight ignorance and stereotypes and racism with karate -- like the Asians do.
===
You're not encouraged to be smart growing up. There are bullies and kids be like, 'Hey, I'll knock the books out of your hands. Now, neither of us can read.'
I would just love to see who was on this bus because you know it's just a bunch of white people in safari outfits who want to look at minorities through bulletproof glass. 'Oh Harold, I hope it comes with a bag of crack to feed them.'
===
There's this new device you can buy for your car and it's got a keyless device and you press it, it's got a heartbeat detector on it. So you aim it at your car, you press it, if it flashes that means someone is in your car and they're going to kill you, all right? It's not going to be good -- so you press it. If you want to buy it it's like $550. If you do not have that money you can do the old school route which is just look in the window.
Mom-and-Pop shops close for no reason. You go in there, you're like, "Why are you closed today?' They're like, 'We're sad.' That's not even a legit thing. Wal-Mart -- you could shoot the entire staff it would be an hour of confusion and they'd be up and running again. That's how great Wal-Mart is.
===
I was at the mall with my grandmother, and there were these two giant thugs in front of us. And one of them turns to the other and starts bragging about how, earlier in the week, he had robbed a convenience store and was stomping on the cashier's head. At this point, my grandmother turns to me and says loud enough for him to hear, 'We should report him.' That's when my quick wit and intellect kicks in, and I realize I need to make sure that he does not think that we are talking about him. So I turn to my grandmother, and I say, 'Bitch, I don't know you.'
A picture of 50 women with black eyes, crying -- a big sign that says, 'Every 12 seconds, another woman is beaten by her boyfriend or husband.' They don't say that every six seconds a woman takes a guy for half what he's worth in this country. There should be a picture of 50 guys up there, crying, with their checkbooks open, a bunch of zeros in the balance column.
===
So we go out, and we get in a fight at a bar, and it was one of those things where it was like an accident. It all started when I knocked this guy's drink over. And all of his friends were like, 'Yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!' My friends were like, 'We're gonna go play pool, dude. Call us later, man.'
I don't care if I go through life and don't help a lot of people or save a million lives. I just don't want to get stabbed. If I can get through life without getting stabbed, I win -- that's how I feel. It just seems so horrible. It's not like getting shot. When you get shot, you don't see the bullet going in. You're just like, 'Alright -- BANG! -- whoa, I just got shot.' When you get stabbed, it's like you're there the whole time.
===
Last fight I was in was in, like, third grade, and that doesn't count 'cause it's like, 'You smell poop? It's over, dude! It's over!'
My buddies back home are always like, 'Hey Vatterott, when you going to be famous? When you going to be famous?' I always tell them, 'As soon as they find the bodies.'
===
I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure... if you die, the cancer also dies at exactly the same time. So that to me is not a loss; that's a draw. It's not like... the cancer's going to jump up and go, "Arrrgh I f**ked Uncle Bert's wife, where is he? I won fair and square.'
All kinds of violence on the TV. You're not supposed to watch violence on the TV. Children, they can't watch it 'cause they're afraid maybe the kids will copy something they see on the TV. I can't even get a funny cartoon anymore because some 12-year-old somewhere watched a particularly violent episode of the Road Runner-Coyote show, and the next day, they found him at the bottom of a canyon, two giant springs strapped to his feet.
===
And the reason I don't like it is 'cause in the old days, they'd go, 'Hey, that old man died.' Now, they go, 'Hey, he lost his battle.' That's no way to end your life, you know? What a loser that guy was. Last thing he did was lose.
If you tickle a stranger, make sure you're smiling. Because if you're not smiling, and this is for real, it's considered sexual assault.
===
See, I've gotta lose weight now to stay alive, and that's not enough motivation for me.
You ever notice when you shoot someone with a gun, they do two things that are really annoying? It's true. They tell you that you shot them, over and over again -- I hate that -- and then they tell you where you shot them, over and over again. They're like, 'You shot my shoulder! I can't believe you shot my shoulder! My shoulder's been hit!' And I'm like, 'That's where I was aiming.'
===
In the obituaries, no one ever dies of cancer. People always give in after a valiant battle with cancer, or they throw in the towel after a courageous fight, which, statistically, can't be possible. There had to have been a couple of cowardly ordeals in there.
My other big obituary fear is, when I die, they'll have my picture, and they always have underneath it, in quotes, 'He loved to laugh.' Oh, he loved to laugh. Well, that doesn't tell you anything. Everybody loves to laugh -- you're laughing! That's like saying, 'He hungered for food.'
===
I have this nightmare all the time where I'm on a dark country road. There's this big man with a knife, and I'm chasing him. Scary, 'cause I know when I catch him, he's gonna kill me.
Look, you've already checked my lead pipe and my bicycle chain, this is outrageous. I need those brass knuckles. I have a very important rumble on the other side of the country, and I can't show up empty-handed.
===
Hitchhikers see me coming, they hide behind trees. I'm so miserable, I pull over anyways: 'Come on -- hop in and stab me. Let's get it over with.'
We're in denial about death. It's unbelievable. Did you ever see these people? It's called cryonics. They have themselves frozen so they can be defrosted when there's a cure for whatever illness they're suffering from -- greedy bastards. That's nice for them. What about their ancestors that have to pay a monthly bill to keep their ass frozen for the next 200 years? Hey, why not freeze themselves in a rented tux? Screw 'em good, know what I'm sayin'?
===
I look at the world in a realistic way. Some people say the glass is half full; other people say the glass is half empty. I look at the glass and say, 'You know, if you fell on that it would shatter, and a shard of glass would cut your jugular, and you'd drown to death in a pool of your own gurgling blood.'
The last woman I dated, she's like, 'Would you fight for me?' I was like, 'I don't even fight for myself, sweetheart. You can run with me 'cause that's what I do. We can hold hands while we run -- keep it romantic.'

It depends how hard you throw them.

I'm not a confrontational guy. I don't like confrontation. I don't know if you can tell, but I have the build of a victim.

What I love about Cosmo is it is this magazine that is pretending to be your best friend. But Cosmo hates you so much; Cosmo just wants to undermine you, and make you insecure. Like, two real stories from the cover of Cosmo recently, one of them was how to drive a man wild in under 60 seconds. I'm just like, when would I ever need to do that? When would I ever be in that kind of a rush? Am I at a tollbooth?

Firstly, who are these "a lot of guys," and secondly, if it's happening to more than one of us, don't you think it could be your fault?'

I gotta be honest with you, the last person who went back there vanished, nothing left but a chipped tooth and a bloody eyeball.'
One of my roommates was a prostitute. And based on my experience living with her, I think that prostitution should be legal because they perform a service for women. They have sex with creepy guys so the rest of us don't have to. Yay, hookers! Every time I see a prostitute, I give her a $10 tip. I say, 'Thanks for taking one for the team, Taffy. I appreciate it. Better you for $50 than me for free.'

When the teacher asks for a word beginning with "A," Little Johnny raises his hand. The teacher anticipates he'll say, "ass" so she calls on Mary Lou, who says "apple."This continues because the teacher knows that Little Johnny knows a cuss word for every letter of the alphabet. Then she gets to "R." She can't think of any cuss words that begin with R, so she calls on Johnny. He exclaims, "R is for rats -- big f**king rats, with 12-inch c**ks!"
While the teacher was conducting her class, Little Johnny yells out,  "Teacher, teacher, I have to take a piss."  The teacher, shocked, replies "No, Johnny you may not because you did not raise your hand. And I will speak to your mother for using that word." So Little Johnny raises his hand and says, "Teacher, teacher, I have to pee!" The teacher turns and says to Little Johnny, the word is 'urinate' and you may not go to the bathroom right now.

I used to be jealous; I'm not jealous anymore. And a miracle happened to me, because if you're jealous, it's a cancer, it's a plague on your spirit, it really is. And I actually cured jealousy in a very weird way -- I cured it with mathematics. And I'm not a math person at all, but I've been with my wife for about seven years, so we have had sex probably, I'd like to think, like, 9 million times or, at least, 1,500. So, the way I figured it, if she goes out and screws some other guy once -- I'm still winning.

The first neigbhbor then asks, "Oh yeah, what do you teach?""Logic," the professor reponds."What is that?" the neighbor inquires."Well, let me see if I can give you an example...you have a dog, right?""Yeah, that's right," neighbor #1 responds."And you have children too, right?" says the professor."Wow, right again!" exclaims the neighbor."So, then you must be married and that would make you a heterosexual, right?'' proclaims the professor."Unbelievable, you're absolutely correct. How do you know all this about me?""Well," the professor says, "I observed there was a dog house in your backyard, so you must have a dog. I also saw bicycles next to your garage, so you must have children. And if you have children, you are probably married and if your married, you are most likely heterosexual... it was all logical!"The next afternoon, the neighbor runs into his old friend. His friend asks if he has met the new neighbor.  The man says that he met him yesterday."What's he like?""Well," the man says, "he's nice and he is a professor of logic.""Oh," says the friend, "what's logic?""Maybe I can give you an example.

Now that's an extreme religion: Amish. Oh my God, it's against their religion -- it's a sin for them -- to ride in a car. Then I heard an Amish guy got hit and killed by a car. Isn't that ironic?

A man decided to spend the night with a prostitute.  When it was over she told him to pay $500.  He said he'd send it to her in an envelope marked ''Rent for Apartment.''  The next day, however, he regretted that he spent the night with her and sent only $250.  When she wrote him a letter asking why he didn't pay full price, he wrote her a memo saying:1.  I thought the apartment had not been used before.    2.  It did not have adequate heating.    3.  It was too large to properly furnish.A few days later the prostitute sent him another letter saying:    1.  You should have known the apartment had been rented previously.    2.  The apartment did have adequate heating.  You just didn't know how to turn it on.    3.  The apartment was the perfect size.  You just didn't have large enough furniture to fill it.

One day, he was walking down Main Street andhe happened to notice a female member of his congregation sitting in the town bar,drinking beer. The reverend thought this was sinful and not something a member of hiscongregation should do. He walked through the open door of the bar and sat down next tothe woman.     "Mrs. Fitzgerald," the reverend saidsternly. "This is no place for a member of my congregation. Why don't you let me takeyou home?"    "Sure," she said with a slur, obviouslyvery drunk. When Mrs. Fitzgerald stood up from the bar, she began toweave back and forth. The reverend realized that she had had too much to drink and hegrabbed hold of her arms to steady her. When he did, they both lost their balance andtumbled to the floor. After rolling around for a few seconds, the reverend wound up lyingon top of Mrs. Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist.    The bartender looked over the bar and said,"Here, here, buddy, we won't have any of that carrying on in this bar."    The reverend looked up at the bartender and said,"But you don't understand, I'm Pastor Fuzz."    The bartender nodded, "Well if you're thatfar into the game, you may as well finish!"

Look at this body! It's perfect! Look at these breasts -- they're real and they're mine! Look at this butt -- it's hard and firm! So why my ears? The guy says, Well, because the person you heard coming was me!

A gynecologist tired of his profession, and wanting less responsibility, decided a career change was in order. After some serious thought, he decided that being an engine mechanic, something he had once enjoyed prior to college, would be a good choice. However, it had been a long time since he had tinkered with an engine and he knew that in order to compete with the younger workforce, he would have to go to school.He enrolled in a technical institute that specialized in teaching auto mechanics.He aced the course, but the final exam required each student to completely strip and reassemble an engine. It was with some trepidation that he took the test. At completion, he turned the engine over to his instructors for evaluation and awaited his final grade. When they were handed out, he did a double take at the 150% grade he received.Rather confused, he asked his instructors how it was possible to have a grade like this. "It is really quite simple," they said. "We gave you 50% for correctly disassembling the engine, 50% for correctly reassembling it, and an additional 50% for doing it all through the muffler."

One day Bill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt. His friend suggested that he go to  a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor.''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10."   Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a  brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:    "You have tennis elbow.  Soak your arm in warm water.  Avoid heavy lifting.  It will be better in two weeks."Later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled.  He mixed together some tap water, a stool   sample from his dog and urine samples from his   wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug   store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:"Your tap water is too hard.  Get a water softener.  Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins.    Your daughter is using cocaine.  Put her in a rehabilitation clinic.  Your wife is pregnant with twin girls.  They aren't yours.  Get a lawyer.  And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis   elbow will never get better."

He asks, "Do you have a dentist appointment, too?" 
A woman walks into her doctor's office and says, "Doctor, I need to lose weight fast." The doctor replies, "Instead of putting food in your mouth, try putting it up your butt."Two months later, she comes in and says, "Doctor, it's a dream come true. I'm half the size I was."  But the doctor notices that she is bouncing up and down. He asks, "Where did you get this twitch?" The woman replies, "I don't have a nervous twitch; I'm chewing bubble gum."

My whole family, all they talk about is food and disease. And they're competitive with illness: 'I have a cold.' 'I wish I had a cold! I don't even have sinuses anymore.'
We lost my grandmother recently. No, she didn't die -- we lost her. She actually shrunk to the point we can't find her anymore. It's so sad 'cause we know she's still in the house, she's just not visible to the naked eye.

A man went to see his doctor."You need to stop masturbating," the doctor told him.The man asked, "Why?"The doctor replied, "Because I'm trying to examine you!" 
I'd much rather have AIDS than a baby... They're not that different at all. They're both expensive, you have them for the rest of your life, they're constant reminders of the mistakes you've made and once you have them, you pretty much can only date other people who have them.

You can't assume the best about people. If I get a girl home and she takes her pants off, and it looks like she's got herpes, I can't afford to assume she got stung by a pack of bees.
You forget how crazy people are in New York, all the people on the sidewalk. When you leave here, everyone's in their car. But I get back here -- I just went to throw something in the garbage, and there was a guy in the garbage. And he wasn't looking in it; he is in it, looking out over 9th Ave like a fisherman.

If I was in charge of the weather and I wanted to get it right, you hire people with arthritis to do the weather because they know in advance when it's going to rain. You see a weather person... with a gnarled hand pointing to the map, you better get your slicker on because it's going to rain. These people are in touch with the weather.
===
I saw this huge billboard that said: 'Abortion Hurts' and then it had a drawing of a butterfly. Who is that for? Is there a lady who's going to see that and be like, 'Oh, I was going to get an abortion but now that I realize it hurts I guess I'll just give birth to a child. 'Cause I know that's painless and raising it should be a snap.'
Like if you're Jewish you have to wear a hat, but only in the middle of your head. But it all becomes clear the second that you realize that God is a 12-year-old boy with Asperger's.

When she was like 17 or 18 years old, she won a beauty contest back in Pennsylvania. She ran like three miles a day; she jogged; she swam six, seven miles a day. She was in really good shape, and she won a beauty contest. She was a good-looking woman. Now, she's 93 years old and really let herself go.

I tried hypnotism, went to the guy, guaranteed. Snaps his fingers -- 'You'll never smoke again.' Got home, doorbell rings -- started acting like a chicken, so I think he messed up.
That's gonna be the next civil war in this country: smokers or non. The non-smokers are gonna win. What are the smokers gonna do -- run?

An old lady goes to the doctor and says, "I have this problem with frequent gas. Fortunately, the farts never smell and are always silent. As a matter of fact, I've farted at least 10 times since I've been here, and I bet you didn't even notice!"The doctor says, "I see. Take these pills and come back next week."The next week the old lady returns. "Doctor," she says, "I don't know what the hell you gave me, but now my silent farts stink like the dickens."The doctor says, "Good! Now that we've cleared up your sinuses, let's work on your hearing." 
I quit smoking cigarettes about a year ago. I gained 18 pounds. So, now I have to wear a lot of black so no one knows what a big hunk of pig I turned into. No matter what I do, I cannot lose this 18 pounds. It's really starting to kick my ass. I mean I have tried everything short of diet and exercise.

===
I love to eat. That's why I got so fat; I love to eat. If I don't walk away from a meal hurting, I didn't do it right. If I don't walk away from Thanksgiving dinner feeling like I've been turkey-f**ked in a gingerbread prison, I didn't do it right.
When you're in your 20s and 30s and you drop some weight, people notice, they're nice about it. They're like, 'Hey man, you look good!' ... But when you're in your 40s and you lose weight, people are like, 'You doin' all right?'
===
My friend goes, 'If you're going to use Rogaine, just put it somewhere you're going to remember to use it everyday.' So I put it right next to my Prozac. But now it just feels really pathetic using both of these products at the same time, 'cause if either one works, I don't really need the other one.
They just tested the tap water in Los Angeles, and they found traces of estrogen and antidepressants in the tap water. So, it's nice to know that my son is going to grow up and some day have huge breasts, but it's not really going to bother him that much.

Joggers tell you that when they run, they get a runner's high. I'm not sure what they mean by that, but if they mean puking all over myself and collapsing, I was pretty wasted.

===
I don't believe in cancer walks. Well, I believe in them because they exist but I'd rather just give money straight up and save my Saturday afternoon. I can make my own t-shirt, that's not incentive. Plus I don't think cancer responds to how far people walk. I don't think cancer's sitting at home, 'What? How many people walked how far? How many people walked how far wearing the same shirt? That's crazy! I'm out of here!' Remission.
Whenever people going through a struggle in life they get really cliched. They start saying things like, 'I'm taking it one day at a time. Just taking it one day at a time.' You know who else is? Everybody. 'Cause that's how time works. That's the only way you can take time. What were you doing it a week at a time before? Who are you? Who taught you how to do that? Please teach me how to do that, I want to get through this quicker too.

A distraught woman goes to her gynecologist. When the doctor asks her what is wrong, she says, "Remember the hormones you gave me? Well, look what happened!"She unbuttons her blouse and reveals her chest, completely covered with hair. The doctor is aghast. He says, "I've never seen anything like this. How far down does it go?"She says, "All the way down to my penis! And that's the other thing we have to talk about!"
A very sick man is in the hospital, and on many drugs which give him bowel problems. After many false alarms, he accidentally craps himself.Very embarrassed, he balls up the sheets and throws them out the window, where a drunk is staggering on the way home. The drunk starts flailing at the sheets, throwing his arms around wildly. A security officer runs over, hearing the commotion."What's going on here?""I don't know, officer. But I think I just beat the crap out of a ghost."

A few days before his proctological exam, a one eyed man accidentallyswallowed his glass eye. He was worried for a while, but there were noill effects, so he forgot about it.Once he was in the doctor's office, the man followed instructions,undressed, and bent over. The first thing the proctologist saw when helooked up the man's arse was that eye staring right back at him."You know, " said the doctor, "you really have to learn to trust me."
I was in New York last Christmas, it's snowing, there's a guy in a t-shirt. I'm like, 'Dude, aren't you cold?' 'No, I'm from New York, I don't get cold.' Just 'cause you're from a cold place doesn't mean you're genetically predisposed to not feeling cold. You're not a penguin. I was like, 'In fact sir, you're Puerto Rican, so if anything, you should be more cold.'

He said what he did was take all of his clothes off, and he stood naked in front of the mirror. I said, 'That's a damn good diet.' I think I could lose weight, too, if I saw Barry White naked, huh? Like, 'You hungry?' 'No man, I just saw Barry White naked. I don't want nothin'.'
You know what scares me about AIDS? Getting it. Outside of that, it doesn't bother me much.
===
It's an ad for Ex-Lax. It's about this chick, she's all bummed out 'cause she's constipated and can't hang out with her friends. That makes no sense, right, ladies? You're constipated so you can't hang out with your friends? I'm trying to picture myself in that situation. I'm like, 'Hey Phil, what's happening, dude? Uh, nope, can't kick it today. I gotta stay home and not take a sh*t. Yup, kind of an all day project I'm working on over here.'
She says, 'Don't worry. You will be cleansed physically, mentally and emotionally by this procedure.' Which I thought was pretty grandiose talk for a butt janitor.
===
I used to listen to that show 'Loveline.' I don't listen to it anymore. I got tired of people calling up for the stupidest problems. People would call up and be like, 'Dr. Drew, my left testicle is turning orange, and I don't know what to do.' 'Are you naked, sir? 'Yeah.' 'Is there a bag of Cheetos in your lap?' 'Oh. You guys are good.'
Do you know that there are people that were born in 1989? That's real. That's true. I have met them. I actually met somebody born in 1991. How is that technically possible? That means that I was already a blackout drunk with an eating disorder, and you were just joining us.

I finally have a dental plan. I chew on the other side.
I don't know when you had one last, but there's one lurking. It'll get you; it's like a bloody nose. You'll get another one.

Marriage is clearly an institution that favors men. It's a statistical fact that, on average, women who never get married live longer than women who do, but men who never get married don't live as long as men who do. That's why we buy women the engagement ring. It's a form of compensation: 'Here, this is for the life that I'm about to suck out of you.'
Ever try to get those pictures from him? He won't give them to you. He's all weird about it, too, isn't he? 'No, those are mine.' Alright, you keep 'em, you freak. Bring 'em home, look at 'em late and touch yourself, see if I care.
===
You got to stay out of the men's locker room, don't you? What a horrible, disgusting place that is, just filled with naked 85-year-old men -- just totally nude, nowhere near the shower, just nude and loitering. When I'm nude, I move fast. I'm looking for my clothes.
Cockroaches are gross, though. It doesn't even sound like a bug; it sounds like the world's worst STD. It's like, 'You hear about Cindy? She's got crabs.' 'That's nothing. Bob -- cockroaches.'
===
I would like to get married before I get herpes.
I think I'm just going to let my eggs rot in my body. I'm just going to do the same thing I do with, like, baby carrots, where I just buy them, put them at the bottom of my fridge, wait 'til they're oozing brown liquid, and then throw them away. So, thanks very much, but I'm going to just stay barren.
===
I went to the doctor and I found out that I can't have children. The medical reason, as far as I understand it, is that when I ejaculate, there is rarely, if ever, a woman in the room.
Then the rectal exam comes. He puts on these rubber gloves. I'm like, 'Please tell me you work at Subway. What -- do you do catering on the side?'
===
I watched a commercial on the other day, could not believe it. Guy walks into a locker room, puts his foot up on a stool -- his foot catches on fire! He says, 'Bad case of athlete's foot.' Good thing this guy didn't have jock itch. Talk about great balls of fire.
Ladies, if you get a burning sensation when you pee, it could be one of three things: it could be a urinary tract infection, it could be a bushfire, or it could be someone's talking about your vagina.
===
I recently saw a billboard that said, 'If you smoke, please try these.' Right under it, there was a huge warning label, 'Warning: Surgeon General has determined smoking causes lung cancer.' That's kind of an insane message when you consider cigarettes kill more than a thousand people a day in this country, way more than Saddam Hussein. Could you imagine a billboard that said, 'If you're going to jump in front of the train, shouldn't you be wearing Reeboks?'
Why did Santa have to have his balls removed?

I don't like being in the hospital. At all. Not even as a visitor. I don't like being any place that has eye-washing stations readily available. What the hell is going to happen to my eyes in this place that you need one of these machines every three feet?
He called me and told me to come in for a colonoscopy. Now, I didn't know what it was, so I showed up... I don't know what happened after I passed out, but he bought me this ring I'm wearing right here. I think we're dating now.

All the windows are rolled up, both parents are smoking as they paint my room with lead-based paint and drop me off at the asbestos elementary school to hang out in.
You will find that they're all going to school, and they need money for books and stuff. So, you should give them all cash because, one day, you could be on your hospital gurney, getting ready for your double bypass, look up and go, 'Cinnamon?'

One time I went to Bed Bath & Beyond and I didn't have a coupon. People talked about me in line. 'He doesn't have a coupon. Is he all right? You don't think he's dangerous, do you?' One lady felt sorry for me. 'You don't have a coupon? Do you know how to get home? Is your name in your jacket?'
I'm not feeling well. I've got a little touch of leprosy. This stuff hangs on and hangs on and hangs on, and then it falls off.

Laughter is the best medicine. It really is, and I'm not making that up. They've done studies that prove that people who laugh a lot, they actually live longer than people with terminal cancer.
I started smoking in high school. I never thought I'd get hooked. I always thought, by the time I graduate, that's it: no more smoking. But now I'm 33. There's no way I'm ever going to graduate.
===
I start to think that maybe there's something wrong with me. So, I went to go see a psychic, as opposed to a therapist. Therapists seem like a lot of commitment, go back week after week. Basically, I wanted magic, so I went to go see a psychic. I don't know if you've ever done this, but we did past life regressions, find out who you were in a previous incarnation. Want to know what I found out? I found out I haven't been laid since the Civil War.
Cambridge is the kind of place where you can walk into a children's bookstore and find a self-help section. Yesterday, I saw a book for five-year-olds, called, 'Learning to Tie Your Inner Shoe.'

My wife, who tends to be overcautious, had the ultrasound last week, which, even the doctors say, is not necessary when you're adopting.
She was so loud, like all the time, and bulimic. I was always going, 'Honey, keep it down.'
===
My therapist is so weird. I go in last week; she brings her daughter in to listen to my session. I'm like, 'What's this with the kid?' 'It's career day.'
I actually had anxiety for so long I went to a psychiatrist. And I said to the guy, 'I'm constantly anxious. What do I do?' He told me I had obsessive-compulsive disorder. I was shocked. I had to call him nine times to make sure he was certain.
===
I had a huge breakthrough today. In therapy, I finally got to the root of my problem. Apparently, I think I'm a piece of sh*t that the world revolves around.
Did you know that if you go to bed wasted, your brain can't dream? It's like a medical thing. I have my own theory and that's that your brain is like, 'Dude, I'm not going to entertain you after what you just did to me for the last six hours. Oh, you want feel what it's like to fly? Go f**k yourself. I'll be up all night with your liver, figuring out how we're going to make it to 50.'
===
Any kid that has any problem now, they just shove pills down their mouth. Like, every kid 17 years old, 'Oh, we got him on Prozac.' What does a 17-year-old need Prozac for to get through life? When I was 17, my dad's version of anti-depressants would be to, like, hold my head underwater 'til I got a little more excited about living.
Ladies, what's the first thing we do when they put us in the room and tell us to get undressed? Look around and say, 'Now where am I gonna hide my panties?' Don't you roll them up and stick them in your purse? Or you tuck them down in your shoe? I hid mine so well the other day, I still can't find them.
===
I think, in 10 years, hell's gonna be the only place left where you can still smoke.
I was out last Sunday -- I didn't see any signs, nobody to ask, so I lit a cigarette. This woman lost all control of her bodily functions. 'Put it out, please, put it out.' I turned around -- she was three pews away!

Here's my interview for med school. 'So, Ken, your GPA's 1.8, no research. Anything you can say about yourself?' 'Uh, yeah, I'm Korean.' 'Stop! Congratulations, you're in.'
It's tough getting older. You start falling apart, you know? My gums are starting to recede now. You can't tell tonight, though, 'cause I comb them forward.

I was at the dentist the other day. He was like, 'Kevin, you have gingivitis.' I was like, 'Damn it. I shoulda wore a condom.'
I had gonorrhea in February -- I know, I was shocked as well. I didn't have any typical symptoms. The only symptom I had was a searing earache from my girlfriend screaming at me for giving her gonorrhea.
===
Ladies, you know how much you can get for your eggs? $15,000. I don't know why any of you are working.... They're hard to get to, but once you do, each one's like an Easter egg filled with cash. But they base it on beauty, intelligence and athleticism, so don't think you're all going to go get $15 grand.... Some of you might have scrambled eggs or huevos rancheros. We're not saying they're all Faberge or Cadbury.
I've got a friend who's like, 'Just get a vasectomy, man. You don't want kids, just quit bitching about it, get a vasectomy, snip snip, just cut the wires, no big deal.' That sounds like a big deal, snipping the wires. What if you cut the red one and my d**k explodes?
===
I saw liposuction. You ever see how they do that? It's, like, violent. They get the hose -- it looks like they're mad at how fat you are.
7-Eleven's whole ad campaign right now I think is just: 'F**k it. You're gonna eat it.'

At this age, it's really not a hobby, it's just a drinking problem now.
I just got out of the hospital. I had some surgery. I had my mother removed from my back.

Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine.I guess that was why several of us died of tuberculosis.
This friend of mine is into all this holistic stuff, and she gave me these energy crystals. And what they are is -- they're crystals that you grind into a powder, then you blow them up your nose. It's incredible. I feel like I can talk all night. And I will.

I used to temp, and I think there's something about steady exposure to fluorescent lights that can dissolve any trace of a personality.
My cervix is like God to me -- I don't have to see it to believe it exists.
===
I had a really severe stomach ache. My doctor prescribed Dicyclomine. I went to the pharmacy to pick it up, and you know when you go to the pharmacy now, they give you a pamphlet, tells you all about the drug. Right on top, it said, 'Dicyclomine: This medication may cause stomach ache.'  I'll recap. I had a stomach ache. Doctor gave me something that caused a stomach ache. This is like going to the emergency room with a gunshot wound and having the doctor pump two more in ya.
I cannot trust my doctor anymore. I can't 'cause have you noticed that whenever we're sick and they prescribe something for us, the side effects are worse than the original problem? There is a prescription sleeping pill that is supposed to cure insomnia, but the side effects are amnesia and paranoia. How does that work? You're like, 'Hey, how'd ya sleep?' 'I don't remember. Who sent you?'
===
It was probably a young woman, probably a teenager, lying in bed, very early in the morning. Her alarm clock goes off, and she goes, 'Oh my God, why did I set my alarm for 6:30? Oh yeah, I had an appointment to get an abortion. You know what? I think I'll just keep the baby. I didn't want to go to college anyway.'

How the hell is she supposed to figure out which one of these 73 plans is good for her? Well, I'll tell ya. George Bush says, 'You know what? Here's the best way to do it. You just navigate our Medicare website.'... Old people cannot find websites. And it's not like, 'Here's the Medicare website -- have at it, it's easy.'

I love when people are obsessed with terror attacks that are going to die so much sooner than that is ever going to happen -- like smokers. Have you seen smokers completely freaked out at a party? You get a couple drinks into them: 'You know, I live by Ground Zero, man, and my lungs haven't been the same.'

He had no body to go with.
The only thing jacked up about the 80s was the fashions. Remember spandex pants? Rubber and nylon -- who put that together? All that moisture, we had yeast infections for days.

It's always better to have people think you're crazy rather than stupid 'cause stupid sucks. Nobody's nice to stupid people. Nobody even feels bad for them. If you're stupid, people just go, 'What are you -- stupid? You stupid sh*t.'
Plenty of crazy people in New York. There are so many crazy people here, I think it's like one out of every one person is completely out of their mind.
===
My sister actually told me that it was my responsibility as a well-adjusted member of society to have children. Is that crazy? I told her, 'I'm not well adjusted. I'm on Vicodin when I visit you.' It's good I told her 'cause now I don't have to babysit her kids when they're in town.
One day a group of husbands and wives went to a scientific program.  The doctor there was showing them brains from real peopleand telling how expensive it would be to buy one.  He said it was five million dollars for a female brain and ten million dollars for a male brain.  The men snickered, thinking they knew why.   One of the women said, ''Well, why is that, sir?'' The doctor answered, "The men's brains cost more, for they have never been used."
===
Is there any indication we shouldn't be depressed? Are you living on the same planet that I am? Do you ever think that depression might be the reasonable human response to the crap we're going through as a species, meant to propel us into the next evolutionary step or, at least, into taking some different course of action, so that we might survive? Do you ever think that maybe it's the happy people that are really screwed up in the head?
I think, in most cases, the difference between depression and disappointment is your level of commitment.
===
My dad is actually a manic depressive, which is very exciting half the time.
It's not all about love. That's half of it... The other half is about that moment you have with yourself when you're looking in the mirror, and you just go, 'Oh man. I'm going to compromise my dreams, get fat, sick, old and die someday. I kind of want to have someone around for that.'
===
They used to have a smoking section at most airports. No more. They now have these glass-encased rooms. You're not just a smoker, you're an example to other people. You're an exhibit at a futuristic zoo.
I used to do a lot of drugs. I didn't stop because I didn't enjoy them; I stopped because I couldn't handle the commitment.

A biker had been injured in an accident and was hospitalized.  Several nurses each had the opportunity to give him a sponge bath and were commenting on his genitals.

The nurse with the shortest straw went into the guy's room while the others waited in the hall.  Suddenly, they heard a commotion, then moans of passion and a piercing scream.  Finally, she came out of the room with her skirt up around her waist, her panties around one ankle and a contented smile on her face.

I always think, what would I do if someone tried to get me? My first thought is just something dumb, like I'd try to pick my nose and just be gross. In my mind a rapist is just some white hat frat boy who'd just be like, 'Ugh nasty, forget it. Learn some manners.'
===
I've been going to a lot of gay bars lately 'cause my friend works at one. My guy friends are blown away by this, they're like, 'Dude, you go to gay bars? That is weird. If some gay guy ever hit on me I don't know what I would do.' How 'bout you just not have sex with him?
My female friends complain about dating. My friend was like, 'I went out with this guy, and he wanted to sleep with me after five dates.' And I was like, 'No, he wanted to sleep with you after one date. He thought he might have a chance after five. He probably wanted to sleep with you after zero dates, but he thought a trip to Applebee's might grease the wheels a little.'

I've been walking for a half a mile -- I'm tired. I'm looking at a car that's running with the keys in it. My first impression was 'Lord, I said make a way.' I thought that was the Lord's way of saying, 'A.J., get in and ride!'

But in that moment, I pictured him getting to heaven, and there's a sign on the gate that says, 'Se Habla Espanol.'

They heard some one knocking at the door, and one of the nuns asked, "Who is it?" The man at the door answered, ''The blind man!' so the nuns decided to to let him in. The nuns opened the door, and the man said, ''Nice boobs! Where do you want the blinds?"

One more son, and I'll have a football team.""That's nothing," says the Mormon. "I have 17 wives. One more wife, and I'll have a golf course."

What do eggs have to do with Jesus Christ? I understand Christmas. Three wise men show up with gifts, 'I love you.' Symbolism, I get that. How did the egg thing happen? Did somebody walk up to somebody else, 'Hey, did you hear? Jesus rose from the dead.' 'Hide the eggs! Hide the eggs! We gotta trick Jesus. Paint the eggs pink or purple. Put them in the park! Trick Jesus!'
===
All religions are alike. My best friend is Lutheran, and she was telling me that when Jesus was born, the three wise men came to visit him, and they brought as gifts: gold, frankincense and myrrh. Myrrh? To a baby shower? I guess Mary was very polite about it. 'Oh, myrrh. How lovely. One never can have enough myrrh. They call themselves wise men, and they bring myrrh? Couldn't it be something we need, like a cradle? Jesus Christ.'
Religion is basically guilt with different holidays.
===
Christmas always sucked when I was a kid because I believed in Santa Claus, and unfortunately, so did my parents.
All boys' Catholic school is a lot like going to a regular school, except your teacher is a priest -- with benefits. No, I'm kidding. I was never touched by any priest in school. Which makes me think, 'Am I not attractive?'
===
Three men discuss the Christmas presents they bought for their wives.The first man says he bought his wife a vacation home in the Bahamas and one in Jamaica. "That way," he explains, "if she doesn't like one, she can use the other."The second man says he bought his wife a sports car and a limo for exactly the same reason.The third man says, "I bought my wife a negligee and a vibrator. That way, if she doesn't like the negligee, she can go screw herself."

Being Catholic is like having a gym membership. It's like, 'Yeah we belong, but we never go.'
===
I used to hate when I was little and have to go to church. I hated church until the day I discovered wine -- or what we Catholics call 'the blood of Christ.' I was like, 'You give wine to little kids? Heck, yes, I'll love me some Jesus. Bring it on! What would Jesus do? Get me hammered!' I was up to two bottles of Christ a day.
In the neighborhood where I live, there's a fortune teller. I had never been there, so I decided that I was gonna go. It was such a scam. Lady had a crystal ball; she was predicting the most unamazing stuff: 'I see in your future a tall, dark man with big forehead.' I'm like, 'Uh, that's my reflection.'

Next time a golden plate falls from the heavens, go ahead and put it in your spam file. Let's not base your entire life on a religion that's old enough for my dad to be like, 'Oh yeah, that's not true. That didn't happen.'
A family was having guests to dinner. At the table, the mother turned to her six-year-old daughter and says, "Dear, would you like to say the blessing?""I wouldn't know what to say," replies the little girl."Just say what you hear Mommy say, sweetie."Her daughter takes a deep breath, bows her head, and solemnly says, "Dear Lord, why the hell did I invite all these people to dinner?"

I hated Halloween, man. We never could afford a costume, never. One year we were so broke, my mother made us be expressions for Halloween. I'm like, 'Mom what am I going to be?' She'd be like, 'Come here.' She'd fix my face; I'd say, 'What am I?' 'Confused.'
===
The government must think they're God because they want 33 1/3 of your money, and God only wants 10%. I'm no theological scholar, but I'm sure that pisses God off a little bit. He's up there, 'Who the hell is FICA?'
After church service, a little boy tells his pastor that he is going to give him a lot of money when he grows up."Well, thank you," the pastor replies. "But why?"The little boy says, "Because my daddy says you're one of the poorest preachers we've ever had!"
===
I started reading the Bible, the Torah, the Koran, back issues of the Green Lantern, you know what I mean? I was like an atheist with a B plan.
You know how it is sometimes, man. You'll be sitting around drinking wine with a group of your friends or some apostles, and a story just starts getting away from you. 'Yeah, man, I remember it like it was yesterday. I'd seen this dog, it looked like a beast. He had, I don't know, one -- seven heads! And the bush was on fire and talking to me. I'm drunk, but you can quote me on that. I hear you're writing a book.'

Used to go to church, but church is getting too expensive. Cover charge is a bitch. I went one Sunday; they was passing around eight, nine plates. I just pulled my own plate, started passing that around.
===
I'll get God his money when I see him. And if he asked me why I was holding onto it, I say, 'Well, there's a lot of false prophets on Earth. I didn't know who to give your money to, and I didn't want to give it to the wrong person and still owe you when I got up here. Ain't no sense in paying if I didn't make the list, 'cause I'm gonna need that money for cold water and an air conditioner.'

My boyfriend had a hard time telling his parents that he was gay because he's from some Christian Right family out in Idaho, and they couldn't deal with any kind of sexual issues at all.

Why did Frosty the Snowman pull his pants down?
===
I am Jewish; my girlfriend's not. She did buy me eight presents for Hanukkah, though. I was like, 'Why did you buy me eight presents for Hanukkah?' She's like, 'Eight presents, for the eight nights of Hanukkah.' I was like, 'You idiot, there's 32 nights of Hanukkah -- and I like electronics. Now, go to the mall. Religious minimum: $50 a gift.'
I've always felt sorry for Jesus 'cause you know no matter what he ever did, he could never live up to his father.
===
I always felt bad for Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa lived a whole life helping starving children and dying villages, but she could never be declared a saint 'cause she never actually performed a miracle. And it was towards the end, she was desperate to perform a miracle, so she would go up to starving children and go, 'What's that behind your ear? It's a quarter!'
If you have the Old Testament at home, if you flip the corner pages, you can see Jesus riding a horse.
===
I found some gifts at the Christian book store I did not expect to find. I picked one up out of the shirt bin; it said, 'Someone I know received eternal salvation and will dwell in the house of the Lord forever, and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.'

Last time I was out here was not too long after 9/11, and you could not drive a car to the airport at that time. That was one of the first safety precautions: only taxis could go to the airport. Because, really, what better way of stemming the flow of Muslims to the airport than only allowing taxis?
===
We have a whole religion based on a woman who really stuck to her story.
Seventy-two virgins -- does that make sense to anyone? And it's an ancient religion, maybe it was misinterpreted? Maybe it's not 72 virgins, maybe it's a 7-foot-2 Persian.
===
Look at the insane things the Jews believe. The Jews believe that Barbra Streisand is worth $1,000 bucks a ticket.
Everything in my parents house is broken. We play chess, and there are six pieces missing from our chess set. So, we replace them with pieces from my mom's nativity scene. We're playing chess with the Virgin Mary and goats and wise men, and my Uncle Earl cheats. It's like: 'Uncle Earl, that's a pawn. You're not supposed to move him backwards.' 'That's the son of God, boy! You move him wherever the hell he wants to go.'

What does a Japanese tourist think when he sees a big Barney floating down Sixth Avenue? It's gotta be unsettling for the poor guy.
===
There's so much hatred between people of different faiths in the world. That doesn't really make sense to me, especially the hatred between the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims. Those are Abrahamic religions. They have a lot in common. The Jews have the Torah. The Torah is the Old Testament in the Bible. The stuff that's in the Torah and the Bible, that makes up a lot of the Koran. One could argue that the latter two religions are really sequels to the first religion. That's weird -- to hate somebody simply because they like a sequel? That's like if I like the movie 'Back to the Future' and hated somebody who liked the movie 'Back to the Future 2.'
I love going to church; every Sunday, I'm there. The only thing I don't like about it is those priests sure do like to talk, don't they? Oh, they love to talk and talk, but they don't like it when you talk in church, do they? Oh no, they don't like that action. Like last Sunday, I'm in church, priest is blabbing away. There's just a little tiny quiet spot in the middle of his sermon, just a little, little tiny quiet spot. I stood up in the middle of the church, and all I said was, 'Hey! I smell ass!'
===
A gentleman sits next to a priest on an airplane. He sees the priest doing a crossword puzzle.Time passes and the priest says, "Excuse me, sir, but do you know a four letter word that describes a woman and ends in 'u-n-t'?"The gentleman thinks about this and finally says, "I believe the word you're looking for is 'aunt.'"The priest replies, "Oh, you're right. That fits, too. Would you happen to have an eraser?"

Ladies, just know that when you grow your hair too long, you got about two inches difference between really hot, sexy supermodel -- religious fanatic.

Let me give you guys a tip: if you ever go to the Middle East -- Israel, Egypt, any place like that -- don't make the mistake I did. Don't use those maps in the back of your Bible to get around. Those are way out of date.
===
Don't get me wrong, I believe in God. I just don't trust anybody who works for him.
Faith is a huge concept for anyone to grasp, never mind a child. You have to be careful you don't send mixed signals. I mean, when I found out Santa Claus and Easter Bunny weren't real, that made it real tough on God and Jesus. Hey -- at least the other guy stopped by once a year and gave me something.
===
We had our first two years ago -- on New Year's Eve. That's a rockin' birthday. Kind of f**ks any New Year's plans I might have had for the rest of my life, but whatever, kids can be selfish.
That's just what we need because humans haven't made up enough reasons to hate one another. Along with race, nationality, gender, sexual preference, religious or cultural differences -- now, if you're born in June, you're a prick.

My manager's Jewish. My agent's Jewish. Let's face it, show business is run by 2,000 Jews and Oprah, and she lives next door to Spielberg, which makes her Jewish by association.
I don't like interviews after the games, though, because the winning players always give credit to God, while the losers blame themselves. You know, just once I'd like to hear a player say, 'Yeah, we were in the game -- until Jesus made me fumble. He hates our team.'

You think African American males get mad we make jokes that they have the biggest penises? Hell no, man. I'd switch places with them in a second. I'm hung like a Tic Tac, but that's the deal God gave us. Black guys get the nine-inchers, and the Jews get Channel Nine.

Do you guys read your horoscopes? I don't read them because I think they're flimflam. It seems to me what they do is they write them really broad and vague just so they can get as many people as they can to sort of relate to them. What I think they should do instead is write them really, really specific and just make a handful of people, like, freak out.
I am Jewish, so if you're not familiar with what that is, essentially, I am a little bit sad all of the time.

Jesus and Moses are playing golf and they''re on the tenth hole.  Moses hits the ball and it heads straight for a pond.  Just before the ball hits the water, the pond parts and the ball rolls up onto the green.Jesus winds up and hits one about to the same spot.  Jesus' ball hits the water and skips across.  All of a sudden, lightning flashes and a ball drops from the sky.  A fish swallows it, a bird picks up the fish and drops the ball onto a turtle, that walks over to the hole and drops it in.Moses turns to Jesus and says, ''I hate it when your dad plays!''
Jesus and Satan were having an ongoing argument about who was better on his computer. They had been going at it for days, and God was tired of hearing all of the bickering.Finally God said, "Cool it. I am going to set up a test that will run two hours and I will judge who does the better job."So Satan and Jesus sat down at the keyboards and typed away. They moused. They did spreadsheets. They wrote reports. They sent faxes. They sent e-mail. They sent out e-mail with attachments. They downloaded. They did some genealogy reports. They made cards. They did every known job. But ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain poured and, of course, the electricity went off.Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld. Jesus just sighed. The electricity finally flickered back on and each of them restarted their computers.Satan started searching frantically, screaming "It's gone! It's all gone! I lost everything when the power went out!"Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours. Satan observed this and became irate."Wait! He cheated, how did he do it?"God shrugged and said, "Jesus saves."

It cannot be easy being a Muslim in America at the moment.... For instance, there are some people in America that cannot tell the difference between Muslims -- of which there are hundreds of millions -- and terrorists. Now, just think for a second about quite how offensive that is. That's like if the Muslim world could not differentiate between American people and professional baseball players.

Jewish people can look at people's faces and tell if they're Jewish. It's a phenomenon that we have that we can't explain. It's just like black people: black people can pick out the black people in crowds; Jewish people can do the same thing.

This guy came on the screen, and he goes, 'The divorced Christian woman has to be very careful because men know she's been married and she's familiar.' I guess that would explain why people keep looking at me and going, 'Hey, you look really familiar.'

I'm selling these hand puppets, and its Christmas time, and I'm doing little voices for the kids and whatnot.

So I'm putting them in the bag, and all of the sudden, she has a little brainstorm: 'Wait a minute, wait a minute. What if I get them home and they don't work?'
This guy... we were talking about the gender inequality in Saudi Arabia, and he looked at me and he was like, 'It's not really their fault, Kumail. The Koran says that women can't drive.'

Every year in Boston, it's a big deal about whether or not gays can march in the St. Patrick's Day parade. And I have to say that on some level, I kind of see their point because when you think about it, it is a real macho, heterosexual event -- a bunch of guys, in short skirts, on a cart made of rose petals, sharing a bagpipe. That's not for sissies.

If you don't mind, I'd like to take a few moments to talk about racism 'cause it's a serious problem. I'm Jewish, and I experience a lot of racism as a Jew, probably even more than most Jews 'cause I'm a moneylender.
Christians have created a holiday that has become a beast that cannot be fed. Every year, Christmas gets longer and longer and longer. And you don't care, do you? You just take more and more of the calendar for yourself. It's unbelievable! How long does it take you people to shop? It's beyond belief. It's insane. When I was a kid, Halloween was Halloween, and Santa wasn't poking his ass into it!

First night, you get socks; second night, an eraser, a notebook -- it's a back to school holiday.
Did he really think it was feminists? Is that what upset God? That women a number of years ago decided to leave the kitchen and go into the work place and demand equal wages and demand power equal to a man? That's what upset God?

I think it's probably hard to be Muslim. They gotta get up every day at 5:30 to pray. That's why they're pissed off, they're sleep deprived. I got a plan for peace in the Middle East, and it doesn't involve any blood shed. All we gotta do is go over there and take away all their alarm clocks and give 'em Ambien.

His parents explained that they refer to "hats" and "coats."At supper the next day, Little Johnny's mom cut her finger in the kitchen and yelled, "Oh f**k!" Little Johnny asked what that meant, and she said it means "cut."A week later, guests arrive for Thanksgiving dinner. Little Johnny welcomes them at the door, saying, "Hello bitches and bastards! Hurry up with your penises and vaginas -- we can't wait to f**k the turkey!"

A lot of people think that Jesus is coming back. That's fine, it's your right. But you know, I live in New York, and I think he's running a little late. I'm asking myself, 'Alright, what happens if Jesus comes back tomorrow? What -- does he make rounds to churches?' 'OK, everyone who's been good, buses leave in 10 minutes. I'll meet you in front of the post office. I gotta go. Oh, don't tell the Jews I'm back.'
I generally grow this beard out around Christmas. Then, I like to go to malls dressed as Jesus, and what I do is generally walk through the mall, just saying, 'No, no, this wasn't what it was supposed to be about, people.'

Maria gets married and has 17 children. Then her husband dies. She remarries two weeks later, and   has 22 children by her next husband. Then he dies.   A few weeks later, she dies. At the funeral, the priest looks skyward."At least they're finally together.""Excuse me,   Father," says one of her sons, "but do you mean her and her first husband, or   her and her second husband?""I mean her legs."
They're thinking about letting priests get married now -- well, not to each other. The pope said it's a bad idea. He said it would weaken their faith because, after about four years of being married, most people start to think, 'Oh, there is no God.'

My dad's an atheist, doesn't believe in God, but he still demands on saying grace before every meal. Well, how do you say grace if you don't believe in God and if you can't start with 'Dear Father'?

Sometimes, when I'm driving, I'll listen to the radio for hours, and I'll listen to Christian rock by mistake. Because it always starts out as like a Bon Jovi ballad, you know? It'll be like, 'I woke up in the morning/And I got myself some oatmeal/And I put some raisins and/Christ is God.'

Between Thanksgiving and Valentine's Day, every commercial on TV is about giving presents to women...You know why all the commercials are for women? Because you can't advertise what guys want.

A day of silence followed by a three way with you and your hottest friend. Followed by more silence.'

Religion's basically show business. Church is theater -- they got costumes; they got hairdressing; they got lighting; they got fog machines. It's like an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, but with good music.

I get no sleep -- Jehovah's Witnesses always knocking on my door. The worst part about it is that I live right next to the temple, so I'm their first stop. I let them in, I talk to them; I don't care. One time I let this dude in, it was around 5:30 in the morning. I let him inside, walk into the living room; I sat him down. I said, 'What is it you have to tell me?' He looked at me, he said, 'I don't know, I never made it this far.'

At New York's Kennedy airport today, an individual, later discovered to be a public school teacher, was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a setsquare, a slide rule, and a calculator.At a morning press conference, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said he believes the man is a member of the notorious Al-Gebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction."Al-gebra is a fearsome cult, "Gonzales said. They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value.They use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as unknowns, but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, "There are 3 sides to every triangle."When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, "If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes."

I'm still enjoying the single life. Went down to Mardi Gras a couple years ago, that was fun. I went with a buddy of mine. There were some girls up in a balcony. A chant goes up: 'Show your tits.' I joined the chant because I support the cause. The girls show 'em, we threw up some beads -- I figured that's the end of the transaction. Turns out they reciprocate with a chant of their own: 'We want c**k.' What do you do? Turns out, I had some c**k on me -- unfasten, unbutton, unzip -- beads showering down on me. Best moment of my entire life -- cut short: handcuffed, thrown against the wall. My friend runs off, but manages to get a picture before he does. I don't know a lot about prison, but I do know, handcuffed, with your pants down, covered in beads, is not a good way to arrive.
I think Michael Jackson gets too much press, though, because he's one guy. The Catholic Church is like the Microsoft of pedophilia, like giants in the industry. He's running a mom and pop operation with, like, a Ferris wheel, a couple llamas.

Santa was very cross. It was Christmas Eve and NOTHING was going right.Mrs. Claus had burned all the cookies. The elves were complaining about not getting paid for the overtime they had worked making toys, and were threatening to go on strike. The reindeer had been drinking eggnog all afternoon. To make matters worse, a few of the other elves had taken the sleigh out for a spin earlier in the day and had crashed it into a tree.Santa was furious. "I can't believe it! I've got to deliver millions of presents all over the world in just a few hours, and all of my reindeer are drunk, the elves are walking out, and I don't even have a Christmas tree! I sent that stupid little angel out HOURS ago to find a tree and he isn't even back yet! What am I going to do?"Just then, the little angel opened the front door and stepped in from the snowy night, dragging a Christmas tree. The angel said, "Yo, fat man! Where do you want me to stick the tree this year?"And thus the tradition of angels atop the Christmas trees came to pass...

I don't have a lot of money. Please help me out.''    He left the church, a week went by, and he hadn't won the lottery, so he walked into a synagogue.    ''Come on, God,'' he said. ''I really need this money. My mom needs surgery and I have bills to pay. Please let me win the lottery.''    He left the synagogue, a week went by, and he didn't win the lottery. So, he went to a mosque and started to pray again.    ''You're starting to disappoint me, God,'' he said. ''I've prayed and prayed. If you just let me win the lottery, I'll be a better person. I don't have to win the jackpot, just enough to get me out of debt. I'll give some to charity, even. Just let me win the lottery.''    John thought this did it, so he got up and walked outside.     The clouds opened up and a booming voice said, ''John, buy a fucking lottery ticket.''

The pope and a lawyer are on the elevator to heaven. When they arrive at the gates, there's a mad rush of angels, saints, and other holy people on their way to greet them. When they arrive, they pick the lawyer up on their shoulders and carry him off cheering hysterically. The pope is deeply saddened. St. Peter sees this and goes over to him and says, "Don't feel bad. We get popes in here all the time, it's not every day we get a lawyer."
The Pope goes to New York.  He is picked up at the airport by a limousine.  He looks at the beautiful car and says to the driver, ''You know, I hardly ever get to drive.  Would you please let me?''     The driver is understandably hesistant and says, ''I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm supposed to do that.''     But the pope persists, ''Please?''     The driver finally lets up. ''Oh, all right, I can't really say no to the pope.''      So the pope takes the wheel, and boy, is he a speed demon!  He hits the gas and goes around 100 mph in a 45 zone.  A policeman notices and pulls him over.  The cop walks up and asks the pope to roll down the window.  Startled and surprised,  the young officer asks the pope to wait a minute.  He goes back to his patrol car and radios the chief.    Cop: ''Chief, I have a problem.''  Chief: ''What sort of problem?''  Cop: ''Well, you see, I pulled over this guy for driving  way over the speed limit but it's someone really important.''  Chief: ''Important like the mayor?''  Cop: ''No, no, much more important than that.''  Chief: ''Important like the governor?''  Cop: ''Wayyyyyy more important than that.''  Chief: ''Like the president?''  Cop: ''More.''  Chief: ''Who's more important than the president?''  Cop: ''I don't know, but he's got the pope DRIVING for him!''

I herby give you the gift of life. You have 30 minutes to do whatever you desire."And with that command, the statues came to life, smiled at each other, ran toward some nearby woods and dove behind a couple of bushes.The angel smiled to himself as he listened to the two statues giggling, bushes rustling and twigs snapping. After 15 minutes, the two statues emerged from the bushes, satisfied and smiling.  Puzzled, the angel looked at his watch and asked the statues, "You still have 15 minutes. Would you like to continue?"The male statue looked at the female and asked, "Do you want to do it again?"Smiling, the female statue said, "Sure. But this time you hold the pigeon down and I'll crap on its head."

A young man and a young woman were soon to be married, but they both had a problem they had never told anyone else about.  The man approached his father one day before the wedding and told him about his problem.  His feet REALLY stunk, even if he washed them constantly, he was worried that this would scare off his new bride, so he needed a solution, fast.  His father pondered the situation and finally told his son to wear socks constantly (even to bed) and always wash his feet whenever he got a chance.The son thought about this and went along happy.    The same day the young lady approached her mother and told her about her problem.  Her morning breath was horrid.  Her mother reassured her and told her everyone had bad morning breath.  The young woman told her mother that this was not normal morning breath but easily the worst in the world.  The mother thinks about this and comes up with this bright idea.  She tells her daughter to get up earlier than everyone else and don't say a thing, go make breakfast and then brush her teeth while the others are eating.  The young woman thinks and then runs off to get ready for the wedding, happy.The couple is married and they are happy, him with his perpetual socks and her with her morning silences.  One morning about 5:30 am the young man wakes up to find one sock missing.  He starts rustling around in the bed looking for it, which of course wakes up his wife, who without thinking asks what's wrong.    With a look of shock on his face the young man says, ''OH MY GOD! You've swallowed my sock!''

These kids used to make unreasonable demands of me all the time. They'd want to use the restroom. Seriously -- straight-faced, they'd ask me, 'Mr. Barry, can I go to the bathroom?' I'd be like, 'No, of course not. I can't leave. You can't leave.' The kid would always give me the same threat: 'Well, if you don't let me go, I'm just going to pee in the corner.' I'm like, 'Go ahead. I'm subbing for the teacher, not the janitor.'

Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is  larger than the shaft.  The study took two years   and cost over $1.2 million.  The study concluded   that the reason the head of a man's penis is   larger than the shaft was to provide the man   with more pleasure during sex.After the results were published, France decided   to conduct their own study on the same subject.    They were convinced that the results of the   British study was incorrect.  After three years   of research at a cost of in excess of $2   million, the French researchers concluded that   the head of a man's penis is larger than the   shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure   during sex.When the results of the French study were   released, Canada decided to conduct their own   study.  The Canucks didn't really trust British   or French studies.  So, after nearly three weeks   of intensive research and a cost of right around   $75.00, the Canadian study was complete.  They   concluded that the reason the head on a man's   penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent   your hand from flying off and hitting you in the   forehead!

Whether the cause is a previous night of drinking or a big lunch, the outcome is the same: Farts.Seventy percent of the time, we can dispense freely. The other 30% of the time, such as at work, we have some tough decisions to make. This document is intended to help you in those decisions.Holders - The obvious choice is just plain holding it in. A popular choice among the females and an almost impossible choice for males. I am not in favor of holding, as I believe the medical community has not done enough research about the long-term damage of holding. Really, where does it go if you hold it in? So be forewarned, using this tactic is to be done at your own risk.Desk Jockey -  When deciding to release right at your desk, one has many factors to consider: - Do you have your own office? Feel free to fart at will risk free. After commencing, I highly recommend locking the door and feigning you are not in the office to avoid any unwanted visitors. I also highly recommend against spraying air freshener, as the smell of the freshener is a dead giveaway. Candles are a good alternative solution for the females.- Are you seated at a cubicle or open desk? If so, one has to consider the proximity of the other workers and the density of workers in the area. If it is just you and one other person in the area, there is nowhere to place the blame. If others are fairly distant to you, the smell will dissipate by the time it reaches the others on all but the most egregious of days. There is always the chance of dispensing at higher decibels than anticipated due to the highly unstable nature of farts. In these most unfortunate situations, you will have to use cover up sounds such as scraping your heal on the floor. I recommend practicing making sounds covering a wide range of tones and pitches in anticipation of such an event. Dropping objects such as staplers, binders and tape may not produce a similar sound, but if done in rapid succession could distract others from the initial event.Meetings: - Sometimes the urge strikes at the most inopportune time. Meetings and gas really do not mix. Releasing at a meeting is by far the trickiest of all the situations one could find oneself in. Although I am against holding in general, a meeting may be the time for it. It really depends if you have established baseline farts before the meeting. This will give you a sense of the decibel and scent level of what is to be expected. Warning: Do not ever use a meeting as the place to establish a baseline. Of course none of the above applies if you are meeting with vendors. You have free reign to do whatever you like.Aisle Walker: - Releasing while walking around the office is a popular option. By the time the scent disseminates, you should be nowhere near the scene of the incident. The added benefit is that if the release is done at higher decibels than anticipated, you can break out into an all out sprint thereby fleeing the scene before others even look up to notice.Broom Closet: - One option is to find a broom closet and release inside the closet. The only drawback is explaining why you were in the broom closet if you are caught entering or leaving the closet. I found stashing stationery supplies in the closet provides a nice excuse. People will love you for informing them about the backup stationery supply cabinet. Of course, you then have to find another closet, as your original place will become too risky.And remember, if you're workplace has many open flames, you are on your own.

A businessman was about to go on a long business trip, and was worried that his wife would cheat on him while he was gone. So to prevent this, he visited the local sex shop in order to buy his wife a vibrator to keep her occupied in his absence.After examining the products, he hadn't found an appropriately amazing vibrator and asked the store clerk for help. The store clerk recommended the "Voodoo D**k.""How does it work?" asked the businessman.The clerk unwrapped the Voodoo D**k from its ceremonial tiki box and said to it, "Voodoo D**k that door." The vibrator flew out of the box and attacked the door with such vigor that the door split in half."Fantastic," said the man. "I'll take it!"He instructed his wife on how to use the Voodoo D**k and left on his business trip. Soon, his wife decided to try it out and said the magic words: "Voodoo D**k my p***y."The Voodoo D**k flew out of the box and gave her orgasm after orgasm. But soon it became too much, and she couldn't figure out how to make it stop. So she got into her car and began driving to the hospital, swerving so much that she got pulled over by the police. The policeman asked her why she was driving so recklessly and she explained to him that she had a Voodoo D**k inside her that wouldn't leave her alone.The policeman looked at her skeptically and said, "Voodoo D**k, my ass."

I saw a grown man once riding one of those weird standup scooters down the side of the road -- you have to tilt to make it move forward, I think it's called a Segway or a Douchebag Way -- wearing a toga and holding a sign for a pizza sale. My first thought was, 'Congrats, you've hit rock bottom.' But my second thought was, 'If you took away just the sign, then that guy would rule.'
===
The neighborhood I grew up in had a sign that said, 'Go Slow -- Deaf Child'... Nowadays, I drive by that sign and all I can think is, 'When is this deaf kid gonna get his act together and move out of his parents' house?'
Am I the only person who blames global warming entirely on the Amish? Are they not a constant reminder of how awful life would be without all this great technology? Every time I want to cut back and conserve on natural resources, I just look at the Amish and I'm like, 'F**k that.'
===
A lot of times people complain that their significant other takes too long to get ready to go out at night. I've never had that complaint and I think it's because I never want to go anywhere, so I could care less how long it takes her to get ready. That's just less time I have to spend with her horrible friends pretending I don't want to kill myself. She'll take an hour and a half to get ready, come down and be like, 'Oh my goodness, you were so patient.' And I'll be like, 'For what? You look disgusting.' Now she's crying, whatever, I bought myself an extra two hours to watch the game. It's not like she's going to break up with me; she's 10 years younger, she's one opinion away from being replaced. I can say that, I have a television show.
If you don't know, it's when you throw cash on the hos. I came up with my own expression; I like to 'make it hail.' That's when you throw change at sluts. 'Ow, are those nickels?' Yeah, it's a down economy. I'm a baller on a budget, bitch.
===
Go ahead, dumb people, be offended by a joke that doesn't have a plausible premise.
If you like soccer, then welcome to America. See, our country already has entertainment so watching people chase a ball for four hours to end 0 - 0 is not enjoyable -- unless, of course, the bleachers collapse and half of Europe dies.
===
I had a dream I was trapped in an elevator with Michael Bolton, Kenny G and Yanni, and I had a gun with one bullet. Now, what do you do? I blew my head off, that's what I did.
I was just heckling them. 'Aw shut up, you convict. Like I'm going to take advice from you. Yeah, you look like a person who made all the right choices in life. I'm leaving at three o'clock. What time are you leaving?'
===
Every industry has nerds. Here's how you find them -- ask someone what they do for a living, and if you don't understand the answer: nerd.
From where I'm sitting it seems like there's two main schools of status update. The first, and the most common, is just make your lives about as awesome as possible. And I'd be like this, 'Just had a picnic up a hill. What a perfect day.' No, I know what you're like. You're bipolar, you cry for half the morning. But even more pointless than that is the other one, 'About to make an omelet.' What? You are about to undertake the mighty omelet? Thank goodness you told everyone. This sh*t could go any way. Somebody contact NASA.

How to be a bouncer: 1) be an a**hole; 2) stand near a door.
I've learned something on the road, traveling around: state shapes. The easier it is to draw the shape of the state, the harder it is to live in that state. So, if you live in a regular polygon, get the hell outta there. You gotta move to a squiggly area. Culture's attracted to squiggles.
===
You can't have an honest fourth grade school teacher. 'Mr. and Mrs. Jones, Johnny, your son, your only child, the fruit of your loin, is a moron. I have no idea how this kid finds a door to get out of the house in the morning. If I were you, I would waste him and start over. Now, I say that with all due respect.'
My cousin Louie, we walk into a bar, and he says, 'Dom, I think that waitress knows me.' 'What do you think she knows, Louie? The fact that your belly came in four steps ahead of you?'
===
Urkel was retarded, let's be honest. No, he was. If there was a kid named Steve Urkel who went to your school -- dressed like Steve Urkel, eating cheese all the time, always asking this girl named Laura to marry him -- you'd be like, 'Oh yeah, Steve. His brother hit him in the head with a brick when he was five. Very sad situation at the Urkel house.'
I immediately fire back to them; I write 'sysph.' And they write back and go, 'What does sysph mean?' And I write back, 'Shut your stinking pie hole.'

A man walks out of a bar totally hammered and runs into by a snobby woman. She takes one look at him and says, "You, sir, are drunk!"He retorts, "And you, ma'am, are ugly. But when I wake up, I will be sober!" 
For the white people, it would be like if you were going to Vermont.
===
You can tell that he's drunk. You know how? His name is Edward Kennedy, yet he calls himself Teddy. He's so hammered, he thinks his name is Theodore.
I hate magicians, and you know why? They're never prepared, that's why. They always need something from the audience. I'm like, 'You knew you were going to do that trick, Harry Potter. Bring your tricks!'

I would like to begin by clearing up a misconception. Apparently, some people think that just because I'm a dork that that automatically means that I have to be a loser. Let me tell you something -- that is a coincidence.
===
You just can't make up random information and say it sarcastically and have it make sense. You can't just be like, 'I went out on a date with a Jewish girl. She was more rude than a wolfcat -- an animal I've made up and decided is rude.'

I go, 'Hi, is Jane there?' He goes, 'No, for crying out loud. You dialed the wrong number.' I go, 'I didn't dial the wrong number. You just picked up the wrong damn phone.'

Every gym, the water fountain situation -- always the same. There's always one water fountain everybody uses, then there's one three feet below it, next to it, no one touches. Who's it for? What little midget treasure trolls at your gym?
This guy picked up a dumb hitchhiker, and he said, 'Before we go any place, there might be something wrong with my right rear blinker. Will you go back there and check it?' The guy went back there. He said, 'Is it working?' The real dumb hitchhiker said, 'Yes, it is. No, it's not. Yes, it is. No, it's not.'

I have a friend who's in love. He's always bragging about Paris Hilton, like she's the hottest chick on the planet. And I disagree -- mostly because she's ugly.
Thanks for the shortest month, asses -- and the coldest.

I called my grandmother yesterday. She picks up the phone, 'Oh hello, dear, hold on a second, I just stepped out of the shower. Let me go put some clothes on.' I said, 'Hey Grandma, don't ever tell me you're naked again. Go put a lot of clothes on. Then put some more clothes on. I'm going to sit here and drink and try to forget you naked in my head.' I'll never eat raisins again.

As I was exiting my apartment this evening, I saw parked out in front a hybrid Escalade. A hybrid Escalade. Come to terms with that reality. What kind of people are buying a hybrid Escalade? 'Well, you see, I'm an environmentalist. And my husband's a fucking douchebag. And this is how we compromise to keep our sham marriage alive.'
The first article's called 'Top Ten Endangered Places.' Here's the first sentence: 'Climate change and tourism are threatening to destroy these natural wonders.' I'm kind of surprised here. Clearly tourism is in the best interest of the airline industry. Way to go, man; some responsibility, airline. But then I read rest of the sentence: 'Climate change and tourism are threatening to destroy these natural wonders. So you might want to plan a trip now before these sights are gone for good.' We're screwed. We're screwed because some corporations are treating the planet like we're in second semester senior year. 'It's almost over. F**k it.'

My sister had this procedure where she goes in, she gets some of the fat sucked out of her bottom and injected into her cheeks to give her that fuller facial look. Now, the bad news is she doesn't look any better. But the good news is I now officially get to call her 'ass-face.'

I'm a geek, but you know what? I'm not a nerd. And there is a difference. Allow me to explain. A geek is the kind of person that'll stand in line to see the midnight premiere of the new Harry Potter movie. That's me, that's how I roll... Now a nerd is the kind of person who goes to the midnight premiere of the new Harry Potter movie dressed like Harry Potter. And that sh*t is pathetic, right? What's up with those losers?

I'm tired of all these old people joining Facebook. It's not for you. All I'm saying is, I don't want to go on Facebook and be invited to be a fan of 'The Andy Griffith Show.'
My buddy Brian had a kid a few years ago, and he comes to me this summer and he goes, 'Man, my son just flunked the third grade. I don't know how to tell my kid he's going to be held back a year.' I was like, 'I guess you better tell him slowly so the little dumb ass will get it.'

Dad hates that I'm a stand-up comic, but it's his fault. He did the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life: did the splits getting out of the shower. Let that sink in. Fat man, wet floor -- people, I can't write a joke better than that.
Johnny comes back from school crying and says, "Mommy, all the kids in the school say I have a big head."His mother replies, "No, you don't, Johnny. You have a hideously deformed head. The other children are merely hiding the truth to protect your feelings."

You get to run into these random celebrities; they're just walking around. And I remember, one time, I ran into Dan Aykroyd, and I was like, 'Oh my God, Dan Aykroyd! This is awesome!' You know -- early Saturday Night Live days, 'Ghostbusters.' And I got really excited, and I went up to him, but he got angry at me when I asked for his autograph. And I think it's because I also asked him to sign it, 'The Old Dan Aykroyd.'
He's your basic dad: he has no idea what's going on. He's never done any drugs, but he's burnt beyond recognition.
===
They came up to me, and they were like 'Hey man, you look like Lenny Kravitz! Yeah, Lenny Kravitz -- what? Yeah! Ha-ha.' What kind of a put-down is that? That would be like me saying, 'Hey man, you look like George Clooney with your square jaw and your charm women can't resist.'
Google's awesome because on Google, you can just type in anything and get it wrong, and it knows what you meant. It's like psychic, right? Like two weeks ago, I typed in 'How do you make cupcakes?,' and it said, 'Do you mean "How do you know if you're gay?"'
===
I could never live with you; not 'cause I'm racist or nothing. It's just 'cause as a black man in America, I need to have someone I can come home and complain about white people to. And that just don't work with my white wife.

The only sport I absolutely refuse to watch? Marathon running. Uh -- that looks like a bunch of anorexics in a hurry to get a burger.

My fellow men and women in other cars -- I'm calling them horrible names. Sometimes I think I'm losing my mind. I think this cannot be rational behavior. I mean, is it rational to cast dispersions on the man's intelligence in the car in front of me and then accuse him of performing an oral homosexual act just 'cause he turned his left blinker on after the light turned green?
You know why they call them blind dates? Because when you see the girl, you want to jab something sharp into your eyeballs.

Halftime at the Super Bowl is the best because halftime at the Super Bowl has gotten exponentially worse every year. I use the word 'exponentially' because I was taught it in math class and that was the first sentence I could use it in. 'Exponentially worse' means crappier and crappier and crappier.

You're like a Greek myth right now.

It's a hermaphrodite."The woman looks confused. "A hermaphrodite? What's that?"The doctor replies, "It has both male and female features."The woman looks relieved. "Oh, you mean it has a penis AND a brain?"
===
I think that genitalia is proof that the universe loves women more than men, and I'll tell you why: 'cause if you look at our stuff -- I mean, it's all kind of gross -- but at least with women, it's all organized. It's like God made a little package; it's all tucked in with hospital corners and stuff. And with men, it's like God started to make a bow, and the phone rang.

I'm sure Madonna would love that, too, Bill. What in the hell are you gonna show Madonna that she hasn't seen before? A gut? Your Velcro wallet? A coupon? NFL sheets?

I don't like jazz music, and I don't like it on behalf of you, the common stupid person. Here's why -- hold on, you're pretty dumb -- here's why: because jazz is all about making the common man feel dumb. That's all it is. It's a bunch of guys all playing different songs at the same time. It's just a racket.

I saw a lady a few weeks ago at my gym... She was on the stationary bike, wearing a helmet. I was like, I have to do something here to mess with her; there's gotta be something I can do.

Hustler Magazine is probably the worst magazine in the world. You ever look at that thing? It's awful. You just get the impression that their motto is, 'We don't spend a whole lot of money on good looking women, and we pass the savings along to you.'

The world hates us. They really hate us. I came up with an analogy of how much the world hates us. It's pretty simple. It goes like this: New Jersey is to America as America is to the world. That's us: we're the d**ks from Jersey.
I'm from Long Island, which is the least respected place in the world. I travel all over the country. I could be in the middle of Omaha doing something and the guy comes up to me and says, 'Hey, where'd you grow up?' I'm like, 'Long Island.' And he's like, 'Loser.' Really? I grew up 22 miles from Manhattan; you lost your virginity to corn. I feel like I win that round. I'm like, 'I've seen the ocean. Game over.'

So I stayed in a hotel in Calcutta. The oldest hotel in India, it's three hundred years old. ...So I get to my room. And I can't get to sleep now, 'cause I'm a bitch. The guy just told me the hotel is haunted! I'm scared. 'Cause I started doing the math in my head. The hotel is three hundred years old. That means there's at least three hundred years worth of ghosts in this hotel. So I'm panicking. I eventually panic myself to sleep. I got waken up in the middle of my sleep by a ghost, and I wasn't scared anymore. Because the ghost had an Indian accent. Do you know how hard it is to be afraid when you get woken up by 'B-ooooo-uh'?

A new study shows that young girls' math scores are now equal to that of young boys' for the first time in American history. I thought that was great until I read on in the article. Turns out a woman did the study -- there's no way the numbers could be right. All I'm saying is, if she's old enough to conduct a study, chances are she was educated during the regime when the math scores weren't too good.
Isn't it ironic?' No, Alanis, it's unfortunate. You have listed sh*t for three and a half minutes, and everything you mentioned was unfortunate. Now that you have a billion dollars, perhaps you'd like to buy yourself a dictionary because irony is not a 'black fly in your chardonnay.'

Fred and Bob ask, "Did she donut you?""No" says Mike, "she told me to go and buy a box of Cheerios."
===
So you can tell them apart from feminists.
A friend said to me, 'Hey you need to grow a pair. Grow a pair, bro.' It's when someone calls you weak, but they associate it with a lack of testicles. Which is weird because testicles are the most sensitive things in the world. If you suddenly just grew a pair, you'd be a lot more vulnerable. If you want to be tough, you should lose a pair. If you want to be real tough, you should grow a vagina -- those things can take a pounding.

A woman sat on a plane heading for New York, when the pilot announces that because of difficulties with the plane's engines, he must make an emergency landing.The woman, fearing that this may be the end of her life looks over to a man sitting next to her and rips her shirt and bra off, and throws herself on him. "Make me feel like a woman again!" she screamed.So the man rips his shirt off and hands it to her. "Iron this."

We get in [the club], and we are totally out of our element. There's this synthesizer-computer music going, there's these laser lights and black lights. It's just not our kind of gig. So we're standing there having a beer and all of sudden my friend goes, 'Hey man, check out that table over there. Those girls'. And there was a table of really young girls. Old enough to be in a bar, but younger than us. And I go 'Yeah'. And he goes 'I think they're checking you out'. I go 'Shut up. They're not checking me out'. Of course, in my head, I'm going 'Hell yeah, they're checking me out! What are you not seeing?'. And he goes 'Nah man, I think they're gonna come over'. I go 'Shut up'. And all of sudden, this one stands up, and she's about 5'10", smoking hot. She's got a little, tight dress on, cut up to the hip and she has locked eyes on me.

I'm thinking 'Just be cool, let her down easy...'. And she walks up to me and says 'Hi'. And I go 'Hi'. She goes 'I'm Bridget'. And I go 'Hi Bridget, I'm fifty. And you're hot'. And I go 'So why don't we do this? Look, before this gets awkward, let me just buy your table a round of drinks, we'll call it a night, and it'll be over'. And she goes 'Okay. But we thought you were Cindy's dad. She's puking in the bathroom so we called him'.

It was seventh grade, and I wanted to get Pumas and Nikes for P.E., like all the other kids. And my mom's boyfriend takes me to K-Mart, you know, to get the cheap-ass shoes that they have there. He's like, 'Hey, they look like Adidas.' And I'm like, 'There's an extra stripe, you dick.'
===
They have a section called, 'New Baby.' I don't think you need the word 'new.' They'd have to clear up confusion. 'Do you have an Old Baby section? 'Cause my friend's had a baby, and I let time get away from me, and he's 12.'
The hard part was being the kid that got sent in first to calm Mom down before you dragged in the actual banged up brother. So you'd have to run in, 'Hey, Mom, everything's fine. I just wanted to run in at full speed and say hi. And OK, so, you know Kevin? Of course. Well, you know how his right arm -- usually it would bend like that? It's not bending like that right now. And it's no big deal because we already looked at it. But we were thinking, since you said that you had to go get milk later anyway, then we were all thinking if, when you go, you just might want to take him to the hospital? And if you get peanut butter, get smooth.'

Where I grew up in Oklahoma City, I was one of only three minorities. There was me, a black guy and a smart guy.

When I was in grade school I was into chess club, Latin club, D&D;, computer camp -- everything that made vaginas go away.
I have the greatest respect for your culture; I think you guys do it properly. You have your three or four kids and then you slow down so you can enjoy your late teens.
===
People always ask me that really romantic question: 'Do you remember the precise moment you proposed to your wife?' 'Oh yeah, right after I got the test results.'
I've been a dad for awhile. I've noticed that certain things don't change about a child, no matter what stage of development they're in. When they're really small, just learning how to walk, you always have to tell them the same thing over and over again: 'Watch out. Don't touch that. Don't put that in your mouth.' Now my daughter is almost a teenager. Are we all on the same page on that? Because I really don't want to have to draw a diagram for that one.
===
I can't stop some idiot from crashing into a building or blowing up a bus, I can only be your dad and give you a few pure truths. Number one, duct tape will save your life. Number two, Tupac is alive, but I need you to keep that on the DL because of Suge. And number three, don't be afraid of anything -- except the television news because they're lying to you every night.
You wanna hear a dirty joke?  A boy fell in a mud puddle.You wanna hear a clean joke?  He took a bath. 
===
The interesting thing about our mix -- being that I'm black and she's Japanese -- people say, 'Y'all are gonna have some beautiful children.' I guess. It could be, or they could just have short legs and long arms.
I wasn't a bad kid, but I wasn't a good student, you know what I mean? My mind was just always elsewhere. Even at my high school graduation, I didn't even hear 'em calling my name 'cause I was too busy playing with the tassel on my hat.
===
Why was the Egyptian boy confused?
His daddy was really a mummy.
===
I have a 14-year-old daughter. I had her when I was five.
I know where my daughter is every night. She's with her friends. They come to my house, they go in her room, they close the door, and they light incense. I don't know what's going on in there -- like, I think there's a Zen Buddhist meeting in my apartment.
===
What the hell is a 'time out'? When I was growing up, we had black outs.
My mother gave me my driving instructions. I'm not such a great driver, but I can change all my clothes at a stop light.
===
Halloween, that's the worst time. Girls dress up in the little costumes, you know? It's like, 'Mmm, I'm a sexy French maid.' I can't do that. I just look like a maid.
They don't adopt domestic. You won't catch them with a Bed Stuy black baby -- that's too local, you can see that on the A train.
===
When I was eight years old, I had to do a science project, but my dad just did it for me. I didn't contribute at all. I think the teacher kind of figured it out when the project was called, 'Is My Wife Cheating on Me?'
I really think that the lives of child actors are way more depressing than child soldiers.
===
I grew up in a town called Hopedale, Massachusetts. I was born there in 1964, and the only thing I hate outside of myself is everything else.
What is red and orange and knocks you over?
===
What happened to good names? You tell me, in the last five years, anybody who's been introduced to a baby named Larry. Bring me baby Larry. Show me a baby Glen. Who are we gonna borrow tools from in the future?
They want to get back on their kids for screwing up their lives, so they're your best friends. 'You know, Grandma, Dad's yelling at me.' 'Oh yeah? Well tell him he peed in his bed 'til he was 12. See if he yells at you now.'
===
I always knew I'd get in trouble when I'd find those wrappers from the tampons in the trashcan. They shouldn't be called wrappers. They should be called warnings. It should just say on the label, 'Get the hell out of the house.'
I had this girlfriend in high school, and we had sex, and at first I thought that was kind of hot... but I knew there was something wrong. I was kind of confused, so I went to see my guidance counselor, and the sex with him was so much better.
===
I believe everything in life I learned from my parents. And by that, I mean that I'm divorced.
Marriage is when two people love each other so much that they promise that if they ever, ever stop they'll fill out tons of paperwork.
===
Don't throw a baby at anything -- even a burglar.
I don't have a kid, but I think that I would be a good father, especially if my baby liked to go out drinking.
===
A lot of people think kids say the darnedest things, but so would you if you had no education.
I don't speak French, but I took it for five years growing up. So, if I was in a situation where I had to be like, 'Excuse me, pineapple dog house red, what time is it library?' -- no problem.
===
I love my dad. He used to be a professional wrestler in Mexico. So, it was cool growing up with him 'cause when he hit us, he didn't really hit us.
My mom had me when she was 15, so I know the younger the mama, the more jacked up your name will be.
===
Just remember where you came from: my balls.
My parents were young. They were like 15 or 16 when they had me. I was in kindergarten; they were still in high school. I remember it like it was yesterday. I used to see them in the hallway.
===
People will come up to me, they'll go, 'Gosh, Gene, you don't look Mexican. You look kind of white.' I say, 'Some Mexicans are kind of white; some are kind of brown. OK, Mom?'
You know how you spell words around kids you don't want them to know? My Uncle Snooky always spelled the wrong damn words -- 'What do you say we go out to the c-a-r and smoke some dope?'
===
You ever see your little son in school? You don't even want to pick him up. I'm like, 'Oh hell no, this is not my child.'
Do you remember when you were in seventh grade, when the phone first came out? We were on the phone forever in the seventh grade, right? Twelve-years-old, you haven't accomplished a thing in life, but every time you get home, you run upstairs, slam the door and talk on the phone.
===
A young boy was having a hard time pronouncing the letter ''R,'' and all the other kids were teasing him about it.  To help him out, the teacher gave him a sentence to practice at home: ''Robert gave Richard a rap in the ribs for roasting the rabbit so rare.''A few days later, the teacher asked the boy to recite the sentence out loud.The boy nervously replied, ''Bob gave Dick a poke in the side because the bunny wasn't cooked enough.'' 
We're actually trying to have a baby now. I'm gonna tell him real soon... I'm just kidding -- I'm not gonna tell him.
===
If you're some rich little punk, you can't dress like a gangster rapper. What are you trying to fool us all into thinking? Like, 'Oh my, look, a Crip has moved into the basement of that mansion. Hmm. How odd.'
What's funnier than a zombie baby?A zombie baby in a clown suit!
===
We're at a wishing well one day. I'm with my son and I give him a penny, and I said, 'Owen, you take this penny, you throw it in the water, and you can wish for anything you want.' So he takes the penny, throws it into the water. I go, 'What'd you wish for?' He goes, 'To throw the penny in the water.'
Part of growing up is learning your strengths and weaknesses. What better way to figure out that hand-eye coordination ain't your thing than by getting drilled in the mouth by a red, rubber ball? You only gotta get beaned in the face so many times before you figure out, 'I better hit the books because this is not working out.'
===
We need more money for schools. We need more money for the kids. Ever think maybe the damn kids aren't worth it?
A boy comes running into the kitchen and says, "Mommy, mommy! Grandpa hanged himself in the living room!"His mother runs into the living room, and sees no one there.  Angrily, she says, "Listen. You should never lie like that to me again, do you understand!?!""I'm sorry," says the boy.  "I was just kidding. He hanged himself in the basement."
===
My mom is a major pain in the ass. Let me explain -- my mom is a 'camera mom.' Everybody's got that one person in their family, but it ain't their mom. All they do is walk around and go, 'Wait, don't move, let me go get my camera.' All my life I got that. It didn't even have to be camera moments. Like when I was all dressed up to go to the prom by myself, 'Wait! Let me get my camera!' 'Uh, we don't need a camera for this. I'm gonna remember this sh*t for the rest of my life.'
When I was a kid, I said, 'Hey Dad, is Hugh short for Hubert?' 'No, it's long for "Huh."'
===
The other day in China, a lady had a baby with three arms. Oh my God! They're always one step ahead of us. He's probably making shoes and toys right now as we speak.
I'm single, don't have any kids -- all the blood tests came back inconclusive. I am the five-time 'Not the Father' champion in three race divisions. You bring any chick with a baby and I will defeat them.

A man escaped jail by digging a hole from his jail cell to the outside world. When he was finally done, he emerged in the middle of a preschool playground."I'm free, I'm free!" he shouted."So what," said a little girl. "I'm four." 
My mom always tried to make birthdays special for me. One year, she put a life-sized inflatable clown in my room, like it'd be neat when I woke up. Let me just tell you guys -- you don't know fear until you wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, and there in the darkness is what appears to be a man in a clown outfit, watching you while you sleep. My knees buckled immediately out of fear. What made it even more scary is that he didn't even move. He just stayed focused: 'Happy Birthday.'
===
My daughter will turn 13 in the year 2001. I don't even want to know what kind of sexual practices teenage kids are going to be into by the year 2001. With any luck, everything will be so polluted, she'll be wrapped head-to-toe in plastic and no one will be able to lay a hand on her -- but that's just a father's hope for the future.
I don't want to be younger, I really don't. Every time I look back a couple years, I think, 'God, what a jerk I was.' But with that knowledge comes the realization that I'm a jerk right now. I think that's why old people get real quiet. They're like, 'Man, I'm an idiot. I'm going to just stand right here.'
===
So my wife's pregnant, and people are so idiotic. You know what people ask? They ask, 'What do you want? A little boy? A little girl?' Everything's prefaced with 'little.' Oh, jeez, no! We want the biggest thing possible. She wants to give birth to a 45-year-old plumber named Gus, some guy with a hardhat, smoking unfiltered Camels.
Like that rental car concept, don't you? It's kinda like grandkids: you just abuse them and turn them back in.
===
I went to all the houses in the neighborhood, Dad, except for the houses that said, "No soliciting" 'cause the coach said you're not supposed to go there 'cause those people don't want you.' He freaked -- 'You didn't go to the no solicitors? Tomorrow, you go to the no solicitors. Do you know why those people got those signs up? They'll buy anything. They didn't even want those signs.'
My wife and I had a long talk recently. We decided we don't want to have any kids, and then we decided we probably should have had that talk before we had one.
===
I learned in my car that I could not have children. It was the day that I locked my keys in my car with the engine running.
Hey fool, I thought I told you. I don't want to see your ass in front of Baby Gap no more. You take your ass down to Wicks 'n' Sticks.
===
When I was five years old, I lost my two front teeths, and I put them under my pillow for the tooth fairy. And the next morning when I woke up, to my surprise, under my pillow, I found a joint.
When you have children, at some point, they're going come into your room late at night and ask you to investigate a noise they hear downstairs and I'm not ready to do that. Just have my daughter come in like, 'Daddy, I heard a noise downstairs.' 'Yeah, honey, I heard that noise too.' 'I'm really scared, Daddy.' 'Yeah, honey, I'm scared too. That's why I was curled up in a ball in the corner of the room.'
===
We're lazy people. We've woken our children up to get the remote for the television.
Finally did what came natural to us: we just stood on a beach and yelled at other people's kids.
===
There's a lot of pressure on parents, man, just figured that out. Parents get blamed for everything now. Even when their kids are grown up and out of the house, parents are used as scapegoats. 'I'm a loser because my father's an alcoholic.' No, your father's an alcoholic because you're a loser.
Delivery' is the wrong word to describe the child bearing process. Delivery is, 'Here's your pizza.' It takes 30 minutes or less. 'Exorcism,' I think would be more apt.
===
I was present for all of their births. That's expected of men now. We gotta be there when the kids are born, and I'm still not sure what our role is in the delivery room. As far as I can tell, it's like waiting for your luggage at baggage claim. You just stand there and peer into that void. 'God, I hope that one's mine.'
It's very stressful becoming a parent. You know what was really hard for me? Coming up with names for our children. I panic when I have to name a new document on my computer. Damn, everybody uses 'miscellaneous.'
===
I quit smoking pot. I quit because I saw this commercial on TV -- you may have seen the same one -- it's the one where this kid gets all his buddies together, they're gonna go in the basement, and they're gonna smoke some weed. So, he goes to get his marijuana out of his marijuana container, but there's no pot inside, there's just a note on a rolling paper. It says, 'We need to talk. Mom.' That's crazy, 'cause a very similar thing happened to me, but my note just said, 'I owe you a dime bag. Mom.'
I get intimidated by people a lot, but I'm mostly intimidated by English children 'cause I think that they all sound like they're 50.
===
I believe in capital punishment, and since I was a former teacher, I believe in starting it at the eighth grade level.
I was raised by people that wear lime green polyester pants and white vinyl shoes, and I thought that this was endemic to my race 'til I saw a black man wearing red polyester pants and white vinyl shoes. Then I realized -- bad taste knows no color barrier.
===
We just don't like negative profiles. You've never heard anyone complain about a positive profile. 'Hey uh, is that your kid? He looks kinda smart.' 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, him? No, no -- his mother drank the entire time she was pregnant with him.'
I come from a big family, 12 kids in my family. Whenever I tell that to people, they go, 'Wow, 12 kids, what was that like?' Uh, horrible -- a lot of people, not a lot of food.
===
She would go, 'All they do is talk about sex in your music -- sex, sex sex. There's a lot more to life than sex, Jimmy. Some day you're gonna find that out.' Mom, you had 12 kids, maybe you're not the person to talk.
A little boy came home from school one day and told his mother, ''Mom, today I heard some older kids using some words I don't know the meaning of. Can you tell me what they mean?''''Sure,'' his mother said. ''Just tell me what they are.''The little boy replied, ''P***y and bitch.''His mother said, ''No problem. A pussy is a cat, like the neighbor's Tabby, and a bitch is a female dog, like our Sandy.''The boy thanked his mother, and then went out to the garage, where his father was working. ''Dad,'' he began, ''today I heard some kids using some words that I don't know the meaning of. I asked Mom, but I don't think that she gave me the right answer. Can you help me?''''Sure,'' his father replied. ''What are the words?''''P***y and bitch,'' the boy replied.His father said, ''I thought I told you anytime you have a question like that, you were supposed to ask me, and not your mother, because she can't handle it.''    With that, he reached up on a shelf and pulled down an edition of Playboy magazine, and a magic marker. He then took the marker, and drew a circle around the woman's genital area.    ''Son,'' he began, ''everything inside this circle is a p***y.''''Okay,'' his son said, ''but what is a bitch?''His father said, ''Everything outside this circle.''
===
You think you're tough because you catch a football? That's tough? That ain't tough. Let a football come out of your ass.
I've got a three-year-old son. It's like living with a crazy midget.
===
When I was a kid, the slide was four stories high and you had to climb up like a fireman. And you always bumped your shin on that last rung. And that slide -- it was metal sitting in the sun for nine days. There was no nighttime when I was a kid. There was just daylight. That was a giant skillet, that's what that was.
I'm a little kid; I'm gone 12, 13, 14 hours -- I don't remember anybody coming looking for me. I'm gone 14 hours, no Amber Alert goes off.
===
They don't have backpacks anymore; they all have that rolling luggage crap now. Every time they get home, it looks like they're checking into a hotel. 'Hi, how are ya? What time does the shuttle leave for soccer?'
My all-time favorite movie was the Alfred Hitchcock movie, 'The Birds.' I saw it with my older brother. We get home that night -- I went to bed; he opened up all the windows and poured croutons on me.
===
I went to this grade school where, one year, what they decided to do was divide all the kids up into two different math groups, based on your abilities. The first group you could be in was called the Blue Angels, and it was named after the famous aviators. And the other group was called Group Two. We were a swell bunch of kids in Group Two. The best part of it is, we picked the name ourselves. The teacher was like, 'What are we going to call you, group two?' And we're like, 'Bingo! You got it right there. Four and five is 12.'
In my head, when I was a little kid, I thought that Veronica was like 25, 30 years old. I was just talking to my mom the other week -- I found out that when I was 10, Veronica was 13. So why was she in charge? All she could do was dial the telephone a little better than I could. Thirteen when I'm 10? That's just like hiring a slightly bigger child.
===
I'm not saying whether abortion is right or wrong. I'm just saying I'm a man, I know men, and I'll tell you right now, if men could get pregnant, not only would abortions be legal, I think McDonald's would be doing them.
Kids -- like the new generation right now -- these kids, right, they got attitudes. They're so young, all of them, they got that hip hop attitude, even though they're like white, Asian, black, Latino, doesn't matter right... 'Billy, come and eat!' 'Man, shut up, Mom. Shut up, I'm talking on my cell phone... Nah, it's just my mom bitchin' again!'
===
Not like these wimpy bumper cars they have now with padding, seat belts and air bags. Back then, it was just metal, that's it. It was like sitting in a wheelbarrow. If you got hit, man, there was some permanent damage.
That's a tough and dedicated job to be a class clown. You basically throw your educational future in the toilet for the amusement of your pinhead classmates who didn't pay a cover charge.
===
My dad is retired now, and he moved to Florida. And it's really great to be able to finally go down and visit him now that he's finally able to do those things in life that he's always wanted to do, which apparently is start drinking at noon and then head on out to buy me ugly shirts.
She's an only child. The other day, she asked me why she has no brothers and sisters. I didn't want to get into it, so I said, 'Look, you have an older sister, but you're always missing her by about five minutes.' She says, 'Hey, that's like my other daddy you're always just missing by about five minutes.'
===
I was driving like a maniac to get here on time. I took a wrong turn, and I see a sign that says, 'Caution: Small Children Playing.' So, I slowed down. Then it occurs to me -- I'm not afraid of small children.
I always wanted my family to be like 'The Brady Bunch.' Do you remember what the father did on the show? Architect. He was brilliant. Six kids, two bedrooms -- that was really intelligent.
===
They're actually doing a whole musical review of my mother's life. It's going to be on Broadway. It's in previews; you should definitely go see it. It's called, 'Victim, Victorium.'
She just wrote her autobiography, my mother. You have to pick it up. It's in the stores now. It's entitled, 'I Came, I Saw, I Criticized.'
===
My first girlfriend -- first of all, we never fought 'cause I was 14, she was a magazine.
What's the difference between a trampoline and a zombie baby?
===
u knew who the rich kids were, right? Right up at the front of the line, packet
15 10x12's, 32 5x7's, six friggin' posters. I was way back at the end of the line, not even standing in school anymore. It was packet Q, and it was one picture, and it was a Polaroid -- of the rich kid.
===
We had a daughter not that long ago, a little baby daughter named Sophia. We're nowhere near mature enough to be parents. I'm positive of that. After her first feeding, she passed out, so we wrote on her.
My mom would never get us exactly what we wanted. She would always get us something like it. Like at Christmas, we never had a real Christmas tree. We always had one of the ones you put together yourself. Every year, we lose a couple branches. By the time I was 10, the tree had like three branches left.
===
For his birthday, my sister gets him a pinata... I'm not allowed over anymore because I kept going, 'Hey Evan, I bet there's some candy in that lamp over there.'
Kids are cute; kids are fun. But they're kind of like living with homeless people, aren't they? They just chase you around the house all day long, going, 'Can I have a dollar? I'm hungry. I need a ride.'
===
America's Most Wanted' -- can't stand that show. I don't mean to be a little, you know, whatever, but if you notice when they have rewards for the white kids, any amount of money'll do: '$50 million. Who's seen our little Joey?' Little black kid: 'Alright, $50 and a bucket of chicken. Who's seen him?'
I think the education system is great just the way it is. There's kids in my neighborhood in Los Angeles, seven years old, that can already speak fluent Spanish.
===
I was such a mean little kid. I was like, 'Dad, you know what? You can't tell me what to do. You're not even my real father.' He's like, 'Watch your mouth, boy. I still got the receipt.'
We can't all be heroes... like, if there was a fire, and I had three kids in there, I don't know which one I would save. You can't save them all; somebody's feelings are definitely going to be hurt. And what if you save the kid that started the fire? Now you're living with an arsonist. That's nothing I want to be involved in.
===
We was broke, and on top of that, I had a cheap ass dad, one of those 'I'll make it for you' dads. Everything I got was homemade, right down to my Schlitz malt liquor beer can walkie-talkies.
I went to my father. I said, 'Daddy will you buy me some roller skates for Christmas?' 'Buy? I'll make you some damn roller skates.' Christmas morning, I wake up to some homemade roller skates made out of platform shoes. Cheap ass didn't even get real skate wheels, just took some gold wheels off an old couch.
===
I wanted to make sure that my act was family friendly for tonight, but I don't have babies. So I thought that maybe I could pretend that I had babies and that way I could appeal to the people in the audience who have babies and to the people who like to pretend that they have babies.
Kids are chasing me down. 'Mr. Vallee, Mr. Vallee, what can I do for extra credit?' 'Jimmy, you got 98% in my class, OK? Unless you got Salma Hayek or a bottle of Captain Morgan in your backpack, I can't do anything for you.'
===
My mother... would save her money and take us skiing on the weekend, which was brave. She took a black family skiing. This was the 80s -- brothers weren't skiing, man. People didn't know what we were coming down the mountain. They'd be looking up, confused, 'Oh my God, are those bears? I think I see bears skiing down the mountain! Huh, they're African Americans trying something new. What's next -- golf?'
I know tap water. I grew up drinking it, I did. My mother wouldn't buy anything else. But she tried to make tap water sound delicious. She called it 'city punch.'
===
I've been here eight months. I have been in two earthquakes, a race riot, floods and fires, and I left New York because I couldn't handle my mother.
If you look in your high school yearbook, it's so great 'cause the stuff people wrote in there -- very sincere. I want to call people based on what they wrote in my yearbook. Like, I haven't talked to them since, just call 'em up: 'Hey Susan, what's going on? This is Laura. What am I doing? Staying sweet, just like you said. Thanks for the advice, it is really working out for me.'
===
Stand-up is such a selfless profession. You know, the only difference between me and a surgeon or a pediatrician is that when I approach a couple with a child and say, 'I'd like to keep him for a few days and do some bloodwork,' it's considered inappropriate.
I slept with my mother until I was nine years old. It was OK for the first few years, and then I don't know what happened. I just couldn't do it anymore. I mean, sleeping with the same woman, night after night -- boring.
===
Growing up, I never thought it was a big deal having two white parents. But now I feel like I have to give them credit because they adopted me back in the 70s, when it was still a little dangerous to have the ethnic kid. 'Cause this is before 'Diff'rent Strokes' had come out -- nobody knew what Willis was talking about back then.
How come you can't find lawyers sunbathing on the beach?Cats keep covering them over with sand.
===
When I was little, my dad used to tell me, for my birthday, he's gonna take me out and show me a good time. Couldn't sleep all night -- he's gonna show me a good time. So, we get up at eight o'clock in the morning, get in the car, drive for hours and hours. He'd take me down to Disneyland. He'd push me up against the fence in the parking lot, and he'd say, 'See that? That's a good time. Come on, we're going home.'
This birthday party was awkward enough from the first moment I got there because the only person I knew at the whole party was the two-year-old. So, everyone's just looking at me, asking these boring questions: 'Why are you in our house? How do you know our son?' It's called: the Internet.
===
I'll always dress like this. But let's say I have a four-year-old son, and we're walking down the street together. I'll be dressed like this, but to balance it out, I'll make him wear a three-piece suit and carry a briefcase. And that way, when some stranger walks up to us on the street and says, 'What the hell is going on here?' I'm going to train my son to say, 'We got hit by lightning!' And then I'm going to go, 'Things with Mom are really weird.'
Did you ever have someone give advice, and right in the middle of them giving you advice, you realize that really they're just giving themselves advice through you? My father does this all the time. He calls me up on the phone; he goes, 'Leo, Leo, leave your mother. Seriously, she's killing you. Listen to me, don't waste another 40 years. Because you could be a dancer; you have a dancer's body.'
===
Why'd the boy eat his homework?His teacher told him it was a piece of cake!
My dad used to use his police psychology on us. We would be outside playing; my father would come home from work and say things to me like, 'Lewis, come here. I thought I told you to mow the lawn.' 'Well father, I forgot.' My dad looked at me, 'Well, what if I forget to go to work tomorrow?' I'd say, 'Well, you could mow the lawn. What's the problem?'

How the hell do you have a war and then say, 'Jeez, we don't have enough bullets. We don't have enough Kevlar vests. We don't have enough tanks and jeeps that are protected from the enemy. Go, send your son, and by the way, we're gonna send him there for as long as we'd like him to be there.' Meanwhile, moms back home are having bake sales. This is insane! Since when is it OK that the safety of our soldiers depends on how much Apple Brown Betty Mrs. Maplewood sells? 'Sorry boys, we only sold two pans of bars, so you're gonna have to make your own flak vest with a downed Apache helicopter and some old gum.'

I grew up in Chicago in a white neighborhood, and it messed me up. Then I moved to a black neighborhood, and it was too late 'cause I went from being the only black child in an all white neighborhood to being the only white child in an all black neighborhood. I didn't have skills. I didn't know how to fight; I didn't know double dutch.
I remember growing up in the white neighborhood.... We would have theme days. One time, we had 50s Day, which isn't really a good time for my people, but the white girls would come out with the poodle skirts, all excited. They'd be like, 'Woo hoo! It's 50s, yeah!' I didn't know what to do, so I just wore a sign that said, 'We shall overcome.'

Babies are neat, but raising a good kid -- that deserves a medal. Instead of baby announcements like, 'We're proud to announce the arrival of an eight-pound boy,' wait 20 years 'til you're really proud to announce, 'Our 180-pound boy is finally out of the house. He's drug-free, HIV-negative, and hasn't knocked anyone up yet. We're proud.'

It's weird, though, 'cause this is my first time job and everything, but I could've sworn I was making more money in college just working for my parents as their daughter.

Did I mention that I'm a new father? Yeah, my 13-year-old son just moved back in.
When you wear noise canceling headphones, it blocks out all of the external sound; I wear mine all the time. I even wear them when I masturbate, and I know that sounds a little gross.

You know what lady, your kids get to school on time Monday thru Friday.

My wife and I are discussing whether we're going to spank our child or not. I say wait 'til she does something wrong.

I did this TV show at three in the morning. The booker would not let me tell the meth joke. He said he wanted the show to be appropriate for children as young as seven. I was like, 'If a seven-year-old's watching TV at three in the morning, the meth joke will work.'
If you're from the country, and you had a Wal-Mart in your town, that Wal-Mart's special to you. It just is. When I go visit my parents, I just hang out in the Wal-Mart. I walk around and talk to all the kids that were popular in high school.

1. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.2. A 3-year-old is louder than 200 adults in a crowded restaurant.3. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with roller blades, they can ignite. 4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong enough to rotate a 42-pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman cape. It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of a large room.5. When using the ceiling fan as a baseball bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way.6. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit by a ceiling fan.7.

A little old lady walks into the Bank of Canada with a bag of money. She insists that she must speak with the president of the bank.She tells the bank president that she has accumulated several hundred thousand dollars over the years and would like to open a trust in the bank.The president is curious, so he asks her, "Where did you get all this money?" The old lady replies, "I make bets."The president then asks, "Bets? What kind of bets?"The old woman says, "Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square.""Ha!" laughs the president, "That's ridiculous -- you can never win that kind of bet!"The old lady challenges, "So, would you like to take my bet?""Sure," says the president, "I'll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square!"The little old lady says, "OK. I'll bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10 a.m. as a witness, and we'll see."The next morning, the little old lady appears with her lawyer at the president's office. "OK," she says, "Time to drop your pants and settle this bet."The president complies. The little old lady peers closely at his balls and asks if she could feel them. "Well, OK," says the bank president, "since there's so much money on the line."Just then, the lawyer starts banging his head against the wall. The president asks the old lady, "What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?"She replies, "I bet him $50,000 that at 10 a.m. today, I'd have the president of the Bank of Canada's balls in my hand."

Two lawyers, Jon and Amanpreet, head out for their usual 9 holes of golf.  Jon offers Amanpreet a $50 bet.   Amanpreet agrees and they're off.      They shoot a great game.  After the 8th hole, Amanpreet is ahead by one stroke, but cuts his ball into the rough on the 9th.''Help me find my ball.  Look over there,'' he says to Jon.    After a few minutes, neither has any luck. Since a lost ball carries a four point penalty, Amanpreet secretly pulls a ball from his pocket and tosses it to the ground.  ''I've found my ball!'' he announces.''After all of the years we've been partners and playing together," Jon says, "you'd cheat me out of a lousy 50 bucks?''''What do you mean, cheat?  I found my ball sitting right there!''''And you're a liar, too!'' Jon says.  ''I'll have you know I've been STANDING on your ball for the last five minutes!''

"How can that be if you've been married ten times?""Well, Husband #1 was a sales representative; he kept telling me how great it was going to be.Husband #2 was in software services; he was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he'd look into it and get back to me.Husband #3 was from field services; he said everything checked out diagnostically but he just couldn't get the system up.Husband #4 was in telemarketing; even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.Husband #5 was an engineer; he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.Husband #6 was from finance and administration; he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.Husband #7 was in marketing; although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it.Husband #8 was a psychologist; all he ever did was talk about it.Husband #9 was a gynecologist; all he did was look at it.Husband #10 was a stamp collector; all he ever did was...

On a long walk in the woods, Johhny found himself out late and decided to look for a place to rest the night. He finally found a hut in the middle of the woods and knocked on the door. An old man answered, and he agreed to give Johhny a bed for the night on one condition: the man's teenaged daughter would be in the other bed, and Johnny was not to touch her or disturb her sleep in any way. Johnny agreed, but changed his mind when he saw how beautiful the sleeping girl was and, while she didn't respond to his caresses, she didn't push him away either.The next morning, Johnny awoke alone, but he figured the girl had gone to do her chores and he eagerly awaited her return. Instead the old man walked in, wiping the tears from his eyes. What's wrong? asked Johnny. Oh, I've just come back from the cemetery -- we had my little girl's funeral this morning. But thank you so much for sitting up with her body last night.
===
Little Johnny was in the kitchen playing with his toy train as his father cooked dinner.Little Johnny stopped the train and said, ''All you damn a**holes who want to get off, get the hell off.  All those who want to get on, get the hell on!''''Little Johnny!'' exclaimed his father. ''I can't believe you are using that language! You should be ashamed of yourself! I want you to go to your room and don't come back until you have thought about what you've done!''So Little Johnny goes to his room and comes back an hour or so later.He resumes playing with his train, only this time when he stops it he says, ''All of you ladies and gentlemen who want to get off, you may now get off, and those who want to get on, you may now also get on.  And as for those of you who have a problem with the hour delay, talk to the a**hole in the kitchen!''
Little Johnny was on a park bench stuffing all of his Halloween candy in his mouth. An old lady came over and said. "Son, don't you know that eating all of that candy will rot your teeth, give you acne, and make you sick?""My grandfather lived to be 105 years old!" replied Johnny."Did he eat five candy bars at a sitting?" the old lady retorted."No," said Johnny, "but he minded his own freakin' business."

My girlfriend wants to get married. I tell you -- I hope she meets somebody nice.
You gotta fight. You gotta get out the negative energy. Don't let it build up. You end up screaming at each other over something totally stupid, like, 'Well, why'd you put this spoon in this drawer then?' 'Just to piss you off, that's why! I got spoons hidden all over this house! Keep it up, and your napkin rings are gonna start disappearing.'
===
The biggest thing in my life right now is my girlfriend. I love this girl. I know I love her because she told me.
I don't think I'll ever meet the perfect woman. I might have to get me one of them mail order women. You can do that: you send away to the Philippines, and they send you a wife. The only thing is, once you're on their mailing list, they keep sending you a relative a month whether you want it or not.
===
I love my girlfriend, don't get me wrong. I truly love this woman, but I have the ability to have sex without any emotional involvement. It's a gift.
I thought I was real racist because I was liking those black men -- so black that if you looked at a picture of them, it looks like a negative.

When they get you, they have their own little signature, like Gucci or something like that. When you walk down the street, girls will walk by, and they'll say, 'Oh, that's Gladys' work, ain't it?'
I wish we all had to describe ourselves in percentages of singleness because I think it would be so much more honest. 'Cause then a guy could be like, 'I'm 75% single because 10% of me is sleeping with my ex and 15%, frankly, that's for my mom.'
===
I'm single now. And it's really weird for me to be dating again because, for the last three years, I've just been cheating.
We had to break up, though. We wanted different things -- like he wanted kids and I wanted him to hear.
===
Very neat for a boy; always cleaned up his mess, no matter where he got it on me. He's Hispanic, so he's like, 'Now who's the wetback?' I'm like, 'Hey, still you. Get back in the kitchen, those dishes aren't going to do themselves.'
I made out with a homeless guy by accident. I had no idea -- he was really tan, he had no shoes on. I just thought it was, like, his thang, you know? I was like, 'He's probably in a band.'
===
I just went through a break up, actually. I'm not worried about meeting someone else or being lonely. I'm just worried about all the pictures. But my mom always told me, you know, ever since I was a little girl, 'Never put your face in them.'
I dated this woman for three weeks, and then she told me that she had a penis. I thought we were just role-playing. It was unbelievable. I was so shocked and embarrassed by it, it took me three more weeks to convince her to start wearing condoms.
===
I was asked once. We actually set a date. I knew he wasn't committed because he only penciled it in.
She got really mad a month ago, because she had e-mailed me a naked picture of herself -- which is a nice thing to do -- but then I messed up, and I accidentally forwarded that e-mail to both of my parents. Now, my girlfriend is furious, mortified, but I don?t even care, 'cause now I have to call up my mother and say 'Mom, I am so sorry -- that picture was just for dad.'
===
A couple of months ago, I gave my girlfriend some fancy lingerie, and she actually got mad at me. She said, 'Anthony, I think this is more of a gift for you than it is for me.' And I said, 'If you want to get technical, it was originally a gift for my last girlfriend.'
I love college girls. The only girls I date in college, though, are sorority girls. Why? Because they're dumb. You can trick them so easy. 'I'm your boyfriend.' 'Oh my God! Let's have sex!'
===
There are two types of people in the world: there are those who have lots of casual sex with strangers -- and there's jealous people.
I always said if I ever get married, I would tell my woman -- I love Michael Jordan, I am a Michael Jordan fanatic -- I said, 'Michael Jordan is the only athlete you can sleep with and I wouldn't get mad, as long as you got something signed. You gotta bring back a ball, a hat or something. You can't just give away that sh*t for free.'
===
My friends, they only want to know one thing: 'Did you score? Did you score? Did you score? Did you score?' Hey, guess what -- news flash, guys -- a date's not a sporting event. A date's an opportunity to be in the presence of another individual and celebrate the unique-osity of that person. And no -- I didn't f**king score!
I'm in love with a philosophy major, and she doesn't even know I exist -- and worse, she can prove it.
===
I believe that if you go on a date and you get to second base, and then you go home alone and rub one out -- that's like runs batted in.
Somebody told me the best way to meet women is to do something you enjoy -- right away, you have something in common. So, I've spent the past year smoking dope and watching television.
===
While we were eating, there was a couple on the other side of the restaurant having a fight. It was a huge fight; it was a blowout. They were screaming at each other. When the woman finally got up and stormed out, I noticed that the man didn't go after her, so I did.
How is she not going to know? I'm going to roll in at five o'clock in the morning, smelling like exotic plants, no money in my pockets, glitter all over me. The second I walk through the door, she's going to go, 'You went to a strip club.' What the hell am I going to say? 'No, no, no, I was out tracking unicorns.'
===
When it comes to sex, I like to refer to my wife as Circuit City because she has no interest until January of next year.
My wife and I just took out life insurance policies on one another, so now it's just a waiting game.... Who's gonna be the first to experience certainly tremendous sorrow, coupled with a sweet chunk of change?
===
The name of this song is 'Things We Want to Know.' The first verse is things men want to know about women; second verse is things women want to know about men. Here are the guys: 'Why do you think you're so pretty? And why do you wear the panty hose? And why do you drink so much and don't have no money? And why do you mess with my stereo?' Here are the ladies: 'Why are all your friends so stupid? And why don't you wipe the toilet seat? Why is your fantasy to be with two women -- and you can't handle me?'
I think I'm learning the secret to a good relationship: just don't argue.... They don't know what to do. Why do you think old men mumble?
===
I'm like, 'Honey, I don't know how else to put it. I just want to make sweet love to my wife. I don't know what else to say or do, just please, please come with me to the bedroom. Oh hey, check it out, what's that on the pillow? Is that a crisp $20 bill?'
During our time together, I've experienced everything from premature ejaculation to erectile dysfunction and everything in between -- not that there's been all that much.
===
You know when you're dating somebody for too long, and you just don't want to do it anymore, but you don't want to talk to them about it? ... So this is what I did, it worked out great. I bought some weed, then I put it in her purse and I called the cops on her. It's like a trial separation. It gave me 30 days to figure out what I wanted to do.
She admitted to me recently that when she first met me, she didn't really like me very much. But luckily for me, she really wanted to stay in this country.
===
My friends are trying to get me to go out on blind dates. Big 'NO' to that because all my friends are a bunch of lying geeks. They're always like, 'Brian, you're really gonna dig this girl. She's got Traci Lords' eyes, Michelle Pfeiffer's nose, Kim Basinger's lips.' Yeah, they always forget to tell me she's also got Charlie Brown's head.
A lot of my friends, when girls break up with them, they get all bitter and vengeful and take it out on the girl. They, like, call her at four o'clock in the morning, going, 'Bitch.' Like she doesn't know who it is? Yeah, for a second, she's like, 'Grandpa??'
===
I hear from one guy -- who I don't even think I'm seeing anymore -- calls me out of the blue and then says, 'It's only been two weeks.' I'm thinking, 'Two weeks?! Do you know what that is in girl years? We're talking six, seven, eight, nine years, hon.'
It wouldn't bother me that much if they could show me one marriage that has come from that kind of an introduction.
===
My ex-girlfriend called. She's getting married; she called to tell me. Yeah, she called. She wanted closure. I said, 'What part of us not talking the last year seemed open to you?'
I'm 36, I'm not married -- I give up. I was just at my cousin's wedding. I caught the bouquet. I just took it home and repotted it.
===
I can't get engaged because that involves calling people back.
I went one time. It wasn't voluntary; it was pretty much court ordered. But I thought I could give back to the AA community, you know, see all those single hottie men there. I could be like a sponsor. Have them call me at two in the morning, and be like, 'I want to have a drink.' I'll be like, 'I have one! Come over!'
===
Why don't you get me a gift? I'm still single! I don't know if you can register at a liquor store, but I would like to try.
You don't run into ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends when you're looking good and want to. Last time I ran into an ex-boyfriend was at three o'clock in the morning at Rite Aid, as I'm ringing up Gas X and corn removers. And I'm like, 'Hey, you. What's up? These are for my grandmother, that old bitch.' He's like, 'Aren't they both dead?' I'm like, 'One of them came back, OK? And she's sick.'
===
I've dated three white rappers; I feel like that's 98% of white rappers.
I have a whole checklist of things I need to achieve in the shower. I feel like you get in there with someone else and all of a sudden you're inventing. Like, 'Hey, let me wash your back,' so you can sneak wash your ass. It's very stressful. Whereas when I'm alone that's exclusively what I wash. There's only one checkbox on my checklist.
===
We all know that every man's fantasy is to have a threesome. That's every guy's fantasy. Yeah, great -- instead of one woman I can't satisfy, now I have two.
She goes, 'You just took me bowling to impress me.' 'Well, yes. Another strike for me. Are you ready for my seed yet, or should I move on to juggling?'
===
I'm working on something a little different. It's a technique I call, 'tantric abstinence.' Now, the way this works is I meet a woman, I charm the heck out of her, and then right as she's considering sleeping with me, I say something so awkward that she leaves and I have to start over again with another woman entirely.
My girlfriend right now, she's one-quarter Cherokee Indian. Her name is Partly Cloudy.
===
I don't think she loves me. I think she's just having sex with me for the exercise, so when she meets a guy she's in love with, she's still in good shape. Here was a clue. We're doing it, and all I'm hearing is 'Oh, Chuck, more -- and four more and three more and two more and don't forget to breathe -- three, four. Feel the burn. And -- rest.'
A friend of mine is 30 years old, and she's marrying a guy who's 19. I think it could work, yeah -- and if they're smart, they'll plan the wedding around the same time as the prom and rent the one tux.
===
I know how it is -- you're too scared to ask for what you want. You take a girl out, spend all your money, get that little kiss on the cheek at the end of the night. That never happens to me. I ask for sex when I show up at the door for the date.
You got your number two girl: that's normally that real cute chick that thinks she's number one. What she don't realize is all she got on you is a cell phone number. You change that, she won't even know where to find you.
===
I'm not like the average guy. I don't want a woman with hopes and dreams. How are we going to have a productive relationship and you believe in yourself?
Fellas, if you want to look at the cute girl, all you've got to do is talk bad about her, then you can look at her all you want.
===
I married a lawyer, which I know sounds very impressive. Every girl dreams, when they grow up, they're gonna marry a doctor, marry a lawyer. But me, I had to marry the only lawyer in America with a conscience. I didn't marry the cutthroat, ruthless, gimme-all-your-money lawyer. No, I married the pay-me-what-you-can-whenever-you-can-I-just-want-to-see-justice-served lawyer. I got so ripped off, ladies and gentlemen. Do you know what it's like? It's like I finally banged a rock star, but he's with a Christian band.
I'm like, 'You wastin' all this money on this woman. You can't touch her; you can't take her home -- what are you gettin' out of this?' So, he try to tell me, like it's logical: 'Well, for me, strippers -- they fulfill a fantasy.' So I asked him, 'Well, have you ever tried wavin' that same three, four hundred dollars in front of your own woman?' Oh, they quiet now. You put out $500, your girl gonna do some freaky things, trust me! Trust me! You won't even recognize her... Not only will you get a fantasy, you might get some groceries, too.

One of the things I was worried about: moving in with my wife. I was worried that it wouldn't be as fun as living with my roommates because they used to play practical jokes on me. It was such a blast. But my wife is just as much fun. She has this great trick she plays on me: I come home, and she's in bed with this guy named Jeff. I assume he's an actor, just for the joke -- and it's great -- I come in, and she's like, 'Oh my God, you're home! What the hell are you doing here?' And then I leave. She's so funny. You guys don't think she's cheating on me do you?
We practice safe sex. We practice really safe sex. The other night during sex, we had a fire drill.
===
A friend of mine had a Super Mario Brothers-themed wedding two years ago. Then, a year after that, he had a regular-themed divorce.
We broke up, and my first reaction was 'Fine -- I've been through this too many times. I can't change your mind. I can't live your life for you. You're gone in your direction. I'm going to pick up; I'm going to go in my direction. I'm not going to live in the past. I'm not going to embrace the pain. You go, I'll go, and that will be it.' And I felt that way for an hour and 10 minutes.
===
My wife read every book there was on marriage... Apparently, I'm in every book. I don't know how that could happen, but if you go to any book store and look at any book on marriage, you'll see at least one photo of me about to put an ice tray with only one ice cube left in it back into the refrigerator.
Here's my marriage quiz: your wife comes in and says, 'Hey, do I look fat?' Do you say a) 'Yeah, you could lose a few,' b) 'No honey, you've never looked better,' or c) 'Wait, let me get my protective head gear'?
===
Guys like me never get girls in the movies, right? You never see a guy like me with a girl. Alright -- we get them, and then somebody unties them.
I see all these beautiful women... and then you see the men hanging out. 'Yo, yo, yo -- yo, sweetness, yo, yo -- Oh, you don't want this? Oh, OK then.'
===
The dating game is like investing in the stock market. You're brokers; you're constantly investing time, energy, money -- investing. You want to see return on your investment. Some of y'all out there are dating two or three different women. That's like investing in mutual funds.
This girl I used to talk to, she was cool, but I think we're gonna have to breakup because she's always mad at me. She's always telling me I don't ever take her nowhere. So this Thursday coming up, I told her I was gonna take her to court.
===
I can't be in a relationship -- gas is too damn high. I can't come get you. It's too expensive. Now, I'm dating in the community. If I can walk to you, it's going to last forever.
Women love to read your text messages. Stay the hell out of a man's text message! And men, sometimes it's your fault, too, because you didn't do it the DeRay way. You didn't pimp-proof your house. Before you go to sleep, this is what I do: I send myself a text. That way when she opens it, it's me -- 'Close my damn phone before I wake up and we argue.'
===
A girl will get with you and leave you for the exact same reason. Girls get with me because I'm a comedian, and then they leave me because everything's a joke to me. You didn't see that coming?
I thought it would be so easy to meet guys when I got out of college because it was very easy to meet guys in college. I mean, this was really all you had to do to meet some guy in college: 'Oh my God, I am so wasted!'
===
All of Ken's stuff.
It's 1957, and Bobby goes to pick up his date, Peggy Sue. Peggy Sue's father answers the door and invites him in.He asks Bobby what they're planning to do on the date. Bobbytells him that they'll probably go to the malt shop or a drive-in movie.Peggy Sue's father suggests, "Why don't you kids go out and screw? I hear all of the kids are doing it."Bobby is shocked. "Excuse me, sir?""Oh yes," he replies. "Peggy Sue really likes to screw. She'll screw all night if we let her."Peggy Sue comes downstairs and announces that she's ready to go.About 20 minutes later, Peggy Sue rushes back into the house, slams the door behind her and screams, "Dad! The Twist! It's called the Twist!" 
===
Sex is a very narrow avenue. You only have so many holes and parts, and eventually, you run out of things to do.
If you ever find the perfect person, run so fast that they see flames shoot out of your ass 'cause all the perfect person does is amplify your flaws a thousand-fold. It makes you feel like that much more of a dick: I used to be a partier; now, I'm an alcoholic. It's all in who's judging.
===
I think your marriage license should be like your driver's license: should have an expiration date on it. You should have to renew it every couple of years, and if you don't renew it, it just run out.
Before we got married, she was like a good health plan -- I had full coverage, you know what I'm saying? Once we got married, she turned into a HMO, selective coverage. I'm like, 'Hey, you keep this up, I'm going to have to go outside the network.'
===
It's not really dating. I don't have any money, so we just kind of walk around. She'll always say things like, 'Where are we going?' 'Further.'
My parents have been together for over 40 years, y'all. Ain't that something? That's a long time. Yeah, they're getting married next month, so we're looking forward to that.
===
Why was the 6'6" guy so brokenhearted after his 4'9" girlfriend dumped him?
He was nuts over her.
===
Ladies, you know how you have that guy friend, that guy friend that you like a lot, a whole lot, but not 'that way'? You have the friend, yeah? It's wrong. Because if the guy hangs out with you, you know he likes you. I mean, why else would he put up with your talking?
Ladies, when you have a guy friend, and he's a great guy, and you still won't date him -- do you know what that's like for the guy? It's like going on a job interview and having the guy say this to you: 'Well, Mr. Perkins, wow! This a great resume. You have the experience we've been looking for. We love your attitude. You're perfect for this job, and we're not gonna hire you. No, no, we'll probably hire someone who's far less qualified and has a drinking problem. But this is a great resume. In fact, this is the resume we're gonna use to judge all the other candidates. Now, we're not gonna hire you -- ever -- but is it OK if we do call you every now and then to complain about the guy we do hire?'
===
I used to cheat a lot, but now I do not cheat -- anymore than I used to. It's the same amount.
Get to know your mate. If there's something you need to know about him, just ask him right up front. And choose the right moment because the fellas don't like opening up. Like, after intimacy, turn around, look him in his eye and say, 'I've been wanting to know, what's your name?'
===
Why did the married man sell his complete set of Encyclopedia Britannica?
He didn't need them any longer -- his damn wife knows everything.
===
You ever have a day where you're forced to be around someone you just don't like? You start to realize that they don't like you either, and suddenly you say to yourself, 'Why did I marry this person?'
My wife and I are having a baby -- soon as I get her pregnant. We've been trying. My sperm have been told their whole lives not to get any woman pregnant. They've gotten extremely good at it.
===
Women look at my brother because he's hot, and they get upset. 'He's gay? What a waste!' I say, 'Hey, I'm not gay.' 'What a shame.'
Baby, I'm on my way home, but I'm in front of a 7-Eleven right now. I'm about to rob it. You want a Slurpee or something?' I'm like, 'Yeah, and a honey bun. Be careful.'
===
This is what I realized about women: women don't want a nice guy right away. See, I am a nice guy. I'm like ready-made cookies. I'm Flips 'Ahoy -- out of the box, ready to date.
I met this girl last week, and we went back to my place, and one thing led to nothing. She goes, 'No sex. We're just going to sleep. We'll be friends.' What friends do that? I played basketball with my friend the other day. I didn't say, 'What do you want to do now? Let's take a nap together.'
===
He thought his wife was a flake.
I think my wife and I have reached the point in our relationship -- we know we're never going to get divorced because we know we don't want anyone else to ever see us naked.
===
If you're a white guy and you're sleeping with a black girl, there's only one way you know if you're putting it down like you should. Don't listen to 'Oh, you're the biggest. You're the best.' Don't listen to that -- she says that to everybody. Don't listen to that. The only way you know is, in the middle of sex, she grabs the back of your head, looks you dead in the face, and calls you the n-word. When you can make her ass forget you're white, that's when you know you're putting it down.
I took a girl out on a date the other night. I knew it wasn't gonna go anywhere sexually, you know, because I was out of chloroform and rags.
===
I've been on the road a long time. I haven't really had the chance to see my girlfriend. She called me up; she wanted us to have phone sex. I'm not really into phone sex, but to make her happy, we had the phone sex. It was really nice -- until I got the receiver stuck in my butt.
The first time we were having sex, in the middle of it, she turns into this tigress. You know, she starts going, 'Talk to me, talk to me.' And I said, 'Hi, how are you? How's work?'
===
Reagan would always say something I never understood when he was talking about the Russians: 'Trust, but verify' -- which, to me, makes no sense. If I trust my girlfriend when she says she was home by herself last night, I don't have to verify by checking up -- which I did, and she's a lying bitch.
If you live with a woman and she has a job and you do not have a job, when she gets up to go to work, you get up and do something -- anything. Just put some work boots on and sit on the porch until she leaves. Get your old shirt from when you used to work at Taco Bell, say, 'Tony called, says he needs me for the lunch rush.' Make her think you got something to do. Women don't like when you just lay on their couch all day.
===
I actually have a boyfriend now -- sorry, ladies.
An escaped convict broke into a house and tied up a young couple in their bedroom.The husband turned to his wife and whispered, "Honey, this guy hasn't seen action in years. If he wants sex, I think it's best to just go along with it and pretend you like it. Our lives depend on it.""I'm so relieved you feel that way," replies his wife, "because he told me he thinks you're really cute." 
===
I was coming down the street today with my girlfriend. This guy shouts out, 'Hey man, your girlfriend's a peach!' And I thought, 'Well, that's nice.' And then it turns out she has a really fuzzy face and a stem.
She didn't love me that much, but she moved in with me. That's a plus. And then one night, I caught her making out with another dude on the driveway. That's a minus.
===
You break up with us, we get drunk and then stand on your lawn, and then a cop comes. I'll be like, 'Oh, this is over! I get it. It's over. Gotcha.'
My buddy Tom... he'd been chasing a girl for two years, and he got her the old-fashioned way -- dates and listening.
===
When you unleash the mix upon her, she will understand the beauty of who you are as a human being, and then she will melt and be in your bedroom soon. That's the plan with the mix.
When you're 18, you meet somebody, and 15 seconds later, you're like, 'I love you... I love you! Is that your roommate? She's hot.'
===
I've finally been able to trust and have intimacy with somebody, which I've never been able to do. Like a lot of guys, I just have a hard time getting that connected. I can actually sleep with her in my arms -- spoons position, right? Women smile, they love the spoons. Men would rather fork.
Look at Thomas Jefferson. The guy had illegitimate kids in the 1700s, and they caught him last year. If you cheat on your wife and cover it up for 200 years, you're pretty much thinking you're home free.
===
By 'long term,' I mean you're having sex with the same person twice a week with no condom.
How sh*tty of a boyfriend do you have to be to get dumped by a chick with four kids? Hello -- she's not a catch.
===
At night, when I'm dreaming and a naked woman approaches me in my dreams, I tell her I'm married. How sad is that? I can hear my subconscious yelling at me, 'Nail her! I set this all up for you, you idiot!'
If love was easy, there would be almost no music.
===
In prehistoric days, they had no time-telling devices. How did you get it together for a date? You don't know when to be somewhere. You show up at your friend's cave; he's all upset. 'Where were you? You were supposed to be here before.' 'I didn't say I'd be here before. I said I'd be here later. It's barely now. I'm early.'
I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We just didn't have anything in common. But when that happens, you have to try to compromise. I tried to compromise with her. I remember one time I was like, 'Look, if you go with me to my "Lord of the Rings" fan fiction meet up group, I'll go with you to this ultrasound thing.'
===
You like Mr. Pibb? You get to drink all the Mr. Pibb you want! But you wake up 10 years from now and think, 'Well, I think I'd like something hot to drink.' Well, you better heat up some Mr. Pibb!
Walter: My wife and I heard that coffee is good for your sex life.Jeff Dunham: Oh, and is it?Walter: No. It kept me awake for the whole damn thing. I actually had to participate!
===
Walter: You dating anybody now?Jeff: A matter of fact I am.Walter: Oh, good. Female? Well you never know; sometimes that's the problem. 'Honey, I got bad news and I got good news. Bad news is, I want a divorce. Good news is, I'm on your team now.'
Jeff Dunham and WalterWalter: I think my house is haunted.Jeff Dunham: Why do you think that?Walter: My wife is there
===
Walter: Heh, remember when you said ?Til death do us part? ?Jeff Dunham: Yeah?Walter: Later, you realize you were actually setting a goal.
Walter: Getting married is kind of like buying a new car. You know when you see that car on the showroom floor just before you take it home?Jeff Dunham: Yeah?Walter: That's as good as it's ever gonna look! Pretty soon it will have dents and scratches; parts will start to wear out. Then the new models to come out and you're like "Oh, oh, ohhhh! Honey, can I just sit in it??"
===
I was in a relationship for like eight-and-a-half years, and then I was re-released into the wild not too long ago. So, my internal 'How To Read a Woman Manual' has like a drawing of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower on the cover, holding hands in a rumble seat and sipping sodas and strangling communists. And I'm just waiting until I can unzip my pants and find a family of raccoons living down there.
Those who abstain from pre-marital sex will argue that the greatest gift a woman can offer a man is her virginity. Not necessarily -- everything has a shelf life. I like cheesecake, but not if it's been sitting in the freezer for 30 years.
===
Some couples get engaged, and then they don't set a date. They're just engaged for an indefinite period of time. That doesn't make sense. It's like going to the supermarket, filling up your grocery cart, and then just walking around.
The honeymoon is an odd tradition. You've just taken the vows when you rush off to some vacation hideaway, where you spend every second of every day with the very person to whom you just pledged your entire life. Two weeks apart would make more sense. You've got the rest of your lives to get sick of each other. Why rush it?
===
Marriage scares me. There's a big difference between living with someone and just going out with her. You don't just see the person when she's at her best. You bear witness to the entire process. It can be very sobering. It's like eating a hamburger after you've watched the cow being slaughtered.
I think the secret to a successful marriage is low expectations.
===
There was a guy at my show the other night with his girlfriend, on a Saturday night, wearing flip-flops. It's like saying, 'Hey, baby, anybody disrespects you in any way tonight, there ain't a f**king thing I can do about it. I don't have the proper ankle support to be defending your honor, OK?'
It's very difficult to impress women when you have no money. When I first moved into my apartment, I had no furniture for, like, six months. So, whenever a girl would come over for the first time, I'd have to act like I just got robbed. I'd be like, 'Oh, yeah, come on in, I got lots of cool stuff here. Let me just get my keys here, one second... oh crap, I got robbed! Oh man, they took everything: my indoor pool, my piles of money. Thank God they left this air mattress.'
===
Girls, do yourself a favor, don't ever bring us anywhere to pick anything out -- ever, ever. You don't need us there.
You tell your guy friends you got engaged, it's like hearing someone died. 'What happened man? Wow. He was so young, man. What happened? He had his whole life ahead of him. Wow, I just saw him yesterday.'
===
I had a three-year relationship end. You ever have somebody just freak out on you in a relationship? Things are going great -- after three years, she wants to run out to find a guy that doesn't hit her.
After three years of marriage, there are some questions I'd like to ask my wife. Little things like, 'Honey, why is it that you get three closets and I get the back of a chair? Honey, I want to know, why do you watch TV commercials when you have a remote control?'
===
I went to the store with my wife 'cause we got a gift card from our wedding, and I went with her thinking I could help spend some of the money on the gift card. Rookie move -- apparently, my name is just on there for decoration.
Guys don't want to talk -- ever. We used it up the first night we met you.
===
My wife recently said that we need to talk about our relationship, which was weird 'cause I'm like, 'But we're married. I thought we were done with that.' I thought we did the thing that will end all these talks. I was misinformed -- like declaring bankruptcy and still getting bills.
That's what happens to you, fellas, once you get married: whatever your profession is, you open up a second business, which is a small shipping service, and your territory is your house, and you're on call 24/7. You just pretty much sit on the couch, waiting for dispatch to let you know it's time to roll.
===
I kind of wanted to get married to get my first marriage out of the way.
I get asked advice about the ladies from the fellas. They'll be like, 'Hey, John, is there a way to get a girl from the living room into the bedroom -- sorta, like, close the deal?' And to that, I just have to say, 'Fellas, fellas, fellas. All you need to do to make that happen is give a girl a dose of what I like to call the old Mooney charm -- or as the courts like to call it, "chloroform."'
===
I sucked at being single; I was a horrible dater. I used to get phone calls on Friday night: 'John -- hi, it's Blockbuster video. It's nine o'clock on a Friday, you're not here yet. We just wanted to call and make sure you're OK.'
Guy moves in with the woman: you just mess up her place and piss her off for six months. And she walks around going, 'How can one person leave every pair of dirty underwear all over the floor?' Because women don't know what the floor is for. Women think the floor is a way to get from this room to that room. Men realize the floor is actually a low, flat shelf.
===
I have this thing that I do called 'Mysteries of the Universe,' when I gaze up at the countless stars and infinite galaxies. I realize how small and insignificant my girlfriend is. So, I get drunk and cheat on her with my 18-year-old neighbor.
He's 81 years old, going through a divorce suit. The age of 81 -- and my stepmother's trying to get custody of me and my older sister.
===
This was Cosmopolitan -- they said, 'Looking for Mr. or Mrs. Right? Tired of the bars? Try the laundromat.' Like I want to be 30 and dating a guy who can't afford a dryer.
My sister just got married. I was the maid of debt in that little event.
===
My wife and I just separated not too long ago. Actually, it's a trial separation, which, as you well know, it turns out to be the separation before the trial.
I'm happy with my relationship status: I'm about to get married. I just don't know to who yet.
===
Marriage is great. It'll calm you down -- that and neutering.
It's amazing how women can get what they want from men... They go through three stages: it's sexy, then the little girl, then bitchy.
===
I have a boyfriend, so I started reading Cosmo Magazine for tips. Here's a tip: don't do that.
What are you talking about 'not getting yours'? How about earlier that night when you ate and drank for free, you got yours.
===
She's like, 'Oh, I'm not a 10? What does that mean? Did you settle? Did you have to settle for me?' Which is awkward because that's what I thought we were both doing, first of all. It's a problem now? Isn't that why it's called 'settling down'? That's what I thought. It's not called, 'reaching for the stars,' is it?
Interracial dating is becoming more popular. I see people dating, man -- different cultures, different ethnic groups, different religions, man. 'Cause people looking for love! They ain't got time to wait for the colors to match.
===
Why is a laundromat a really bad place to pick up women?
Because a woman who can't afford her own washing machine won't be able to support you.
===
I have a man in my life. He is so special. This guy -- he kisses me before we do it.
Don't skip 'em 'cause they talk funny -- just because your American is gooder than theirs be.
===
He packs like we're fleeing over the Berlin Wall. He'll be bringing, like, wire cutters and a knife and the passport of a dead man. I'll be like, 'Honey, we're going to New Jersey. Just bring the knife.'
Just broke up with somebody. Well, it wasn't really a break up, it was a booty call I might have took too serious.
===
Women, you can weed out the bad men. Advocate more respect for yourselves. Anywhere you go, carry an English book. As soon as the guy comes up to you: 'Here, read paragraph one. Tell me what it's saying. Underline the verb once, the subject twice. I'm going to go dance. I'll be right back.' I bet he'll leave you alone.
It's a terrible thing when the relationship goes into the danger zone. There's nothing worse than that feeling of imminent dumpage. This is usually the time in the relationship when the couple gets the bright idea, 'I know, honey, we'll go away for the weekend -- just the two of us, work it all out.' That's a great idea. Let's put two hostile people in a four-by-four cabin in the middle of nowhere. They do episodes of 'Murder She Wrote' with that kind of plot.
===
He is the prototypical Italian. He is so Italian, when he gave me my ring, it still had a finger in it.
Me and my black boyfriend, Daryl, just celebrated our two-year anniversary. Come on, folks, two years -- that's nine and a half years in black.
===
You know how that is, the first time in a guy's apartment? You don't know what to expect, right? I go walking in, he's got rows and rows of books -- books everywhere -- maps up on the walls, a whole folder of magazine article clippings. I'm like, 'Oh sh*t, I'm dating a serial killer.'
Marriage is like the movie 'Groundhog Day.' You wake up, you look over at your alarm clock, you look back at your mate, and you think, 'Oh my God, not this sh*t again.'
===
I think you need to create a situation where all these homophobes in Congress think that the gay marriage amendment is gonna work for them. 'Cause really, here's what happens -- when your Rick Santorums and your Tom DeLays and every other kook-bag that's in there hears the words 'gay marriage,' they draw a mental image of two men having sex everywhere: front lawns, nursery school parking lots, it doesn't matter where... They can't stand it -- because you know if they picture two women having sex, it would already be in the Constitution.
I did that on a date once -- I was wearing a bathing suit under my pants because I didn't do laundry. She wouldn't have known except for I had that white string flapping outside of my fly. She was like, 'What do you have -- a tampon in there? What the hell's wrong with you?'
===
Nobody ever wins an argument. Nobody ever goes, 'Oh, I'm wrong.' Somebody eventually just goes, 'Shut up. We gotta eat, so let's shut up for minute.'
This is a wedding in the year 2000. 'Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? If yes, press one.'
===
I'm dating this girl so young she thinks Earth, Wind & Fire are Power Rangers.
I picked this girl up to go out on a date. I get in the car and I look -- she's still standing outside. I'm like, 'The door's open. I got power locks. What you waiting on? You're going to get left.'
===
You know what I like about dating younger guys? They follow rules really well. Like you can tell a younger guy, 'Look, sex with me is like taking the SATs: just show up on time, do the best you can, and when I say stop, put your little pencil down.
You get all excited to give her the ring, and it's real emotional, and you give it to her, and she cries. And a second later, you're like, 'Damn, I could have had a car.'
===
I'm actually dating a professional athlete now. He's a bowler.
I used to be afraid of relationships. Someone would ask me out and I'd say, 'Just take my purse, don't hurt me!'
===
Sometimes I worry I don't want to get married as much as I'd like to be dipped in a vat of warm, rising bread dough.
If you're looking for a man, you're never going to get one.... It's when you're not looking, that's when it happens. It's that moment of calm when you're not even thinking about it, just happy; that's when a man's gonna look at you, like, 'Oooh, yeah -- how can I destroy her?'
===
The most unusual person I ever dated was a cop. She was a police woman. First night in bed she goes, 'Do you have any protection?' I said, 'You.'
I'm in a relationship right now, you know, crossing my fingers. The relationship is great; the sex is great. My friends said, 'Whoa, you've had sex out of wedlock?' I said, 'Oh no, she's married.'
===
I broke up with this girl. It was my doing, though. I can't tell you her real name, of course, because -- well, she didn't tell me her real name.
I dated this one woman -- she had a tattoo above her left breast. I found it really hard to be intimate while Yosemite Sam was giving me the finger.
===
Since I've been out of high school, I've been to 32 weddings. That's like 17-and-a-half miles of the electric slide, folks.
I'm the only single guy left out of all of my friends. I'm the last man standing. It's like my buddies and I were in a war movie, where we're storming the beach with machine gun nests, only instead of bullets, they're shooting rings.
===
We thought it was a bad idea you guys got married, but we didn't feel like we could say anything because it was open bar.
The guys I've been meeting just have the worst pickup lines. Oh my God -- like, 'Hey, what's your friend's name?'
===
Went on a date recently with a woman in a wheelchair. And I stood her up. Not surprisingly, that's when she fell for me and, you know what, then it became a bit of a drag. But now we're on a roll.
My current girlfriend is awesome: she's smart, she's funny, she's beautiful. She has a great job -- she works as a fictional reference in my comedy act.
===
I'm dating again, which is very exciting -- 'cause I'm married.
When you live with someone, that's a commitment. You either have to work out all your problems, or you have to move out all your stuff. I got a lot of stuff -- that's a commitment.
===
Everyone puts music now on their outgoing answering machine. Can we knock that off? You know they spent five hours going through their album collection to find the one song that most represents what they're all about. Like you're going to call up and go, 'Wow, Joel's into fusion jazz. Maybe I will go out with him?'
I support the gays. They've evolved. They don't have marriage, they have something better -- something called civil union. I'm actually jealous; I would like to have a civil union with a woman. That way, when we separate, I don't have to use the ugly word 'divorce.' I can be like, 'Look, sweetie, I don't want a divorce. I simply would like to secede from the union -- then join the confederacy of banging other bitches.'
===
I just lost another argument with my woman... And I thought I was right this time. I was like, 'I got her! I got her!' At the end of the argument, I was like, 'I'm sorry?'
We don't have good arguing strategy. We never really know what the argument is about. We always go into the argument under the impression that what we're arguing about is the thing that just happened. That is, in fact, not the case. This argument is really about everything that I've ever done since I've been in this relationship.
===
I would be gay if you didn't have to do the gay sex part. I don't know if I would like that. I think after a couple minutes, I'd just be like, 'Ow, quit it. Let's just cuddle, dude.'
This girl came over to me, and she's like, 'I saw you on TV.' And I was like, oh my God, I'm going to have sex. I got happy. And then she goes, 'Can I ask you a question?' -- in, like, an all sexy voice. And I'm like, 'Yeah.' She's like, 'Are you retarded?'
===
I got into an argument with a girl inside a tent. That's a bad place for an argument, 'cause then I tried to walk out and slam the flap.
They say breaking up is so hard to do, but have you ever done it by e-mail? It's incredibly easy: point, click, done, bitch.
===
I'm now in what's known as a long distance relationship, which is very tough. I live in L.A., and she lives in the future.
I'm actually dating a guy right now... He doesn't have a car, and I live in L.A., and that's crazy. At first I thought, 'That's it, it's gonna ruin everything. I can't do that. I can't make this kind of sacrifice.' But then I realized, at least when we break up, he's gonna have a really hard time stalking me.
===
Why do the guys get so upset? It's just business. Its hard breaking up with them because you have to be like, 'Listen you've run out of money.'
I've been married four years now and it's getting pretty serious.
===
Have you ever had a one night stand that went horribly awry and just turned into this ugly two year relationship?
In some ways he's like, America's rebound boyfriend. We just want to be able to call George Bush and be like, 'Yeah, we're with someone else now George. And get this, he listens to us. And he doesn't just attack people for no reason. Oh yeah, did I mention, he's black?'
===
Porn used to amaze me. I'd be like, 'How they'd get that man and that lady to have sex at that bakery?' But now the older I get, the more I realize men and women having sex is the easy part of a relationship. You know what's like a fantasy to me now? You know what would be porn to me today? Just video of a man and a woman getting along. Wait, he has to work late and she's not going to take it personally? Oh, that's hot.
My last girlfriend, she was very jealous. She figured, I'm on the road all the time, I'm sleeping with everybody. And I was, but where's the trust?
===
You young guys are looking up here going, 'I'm never going to get married.' That's what I thought, but how many times can you go home, watch SportsCenter, order a pizza and jerk off before that gets boring? I'll tell you how many times: 11, 556.
I used to see my dad out in the yard. I'm like, he really loved the outdoors. Then I got married, I figured it out -- he hated my mother.
===
Does anybody here feel like they're solving a crime reading people's Facebook status updates? Be like, '8:36 PM: Elizabeth is going out for drinks with the girls tonight.' '8:49 PM: margaritas plus friends equals Heaven.' '9:03 PM: some weird guy in a windbreaker just bought me a drink.' '9:45 AM: walking down some highway in Nevada, WTF?!' Guy in windbreaker changes relationship status from 'single' to 'it's complicated.'
One of my best friend's is a professional magician. The only downside to having a magical friend is he always invites us on double dates, and that's the worst because I'm a nice guy, but he's magic. There's no way I can compete with that. He shows up, he's so smooth. Girls love him. He's like, 'How's it going? You look so beautiful tonight. Your hair -- is that a coin? Now, it's a rose. Now, it's money.' And it's like, I show up -- what am I gonna do? I'm like, 'Hi, I brought you this rose. Now, it's broken.'
===
My ex-girlfriend thought I was crazy because I was playing all the time. She thought it was affecting my brain. She's like, 'You're going to kill me 'cause all you do is play the game. You wake up and you play it, you're going to shoot somebody.' I'm like, 'What are you talking about? You watch the cooking channel all the time and you don't cook anything.' She was like, 'Oh yeah, you watch porn all the time and you still don't know how to have sex.'
You ever see 'The Dating Game'? That's a weird game show. The prize on that show: another contestant. Talk about cheap.
===
Men are simple. If she's fine, we're thinking one thought. We're like: 'Damn! I'd hit that.' And if she's ugly -- if she's ugly -- we're like: 'Damn, oh! I'd hit that.'
My mother told me a long time ago, she said, 'True love lasts for two years.' Do you know what else lasts for only two years? Cell phone contracts. What if they got it right? I've left tons of women, but I will not leave Sprint.
===
When you're really in love, you feel like you're the only two people in the world. When you first start dating, and you're like, 'This person's incredible,' and you stop calling your friends -- that's the best feeling in the world. And I've been so lucky to feel like that for the past six weeks, but what's weird is that I'm not dating anyone.
I love women, I really do. I like my women like I like my coffee: tied up in a sack and thrown on the back of a donkey by Juan Valdez.
===
What's the difference between a penis and a paycheck?
You don't have to beg your wife to blow your paycheck.
===
I have a girlfriend. The only thing I don't like about her is that she's super materialistic... So we go out on this date the other night. The first thing she says to me -- no kiss 'hello,' no nothing -- she just goes, 'Well, I wanna see how much money you can spend in a night, mister.' So, I took her to a strip club.
No guy I know wants to fight with his girlfriend or his wife. When we're arguing with you women, and you women are like, 'Hey, don't act like you don't know what the f**k is going on,' it is because we do not know what the f**k is going on.
===
Here's when I knew it was over -- three months into the relationship, we're sitting at a traffic light, and she leans over and punches me right in the face for no reason. I clearly remember thinking, I'm going to give her four more years and nine months, and that is it.
Arguing is totally different when you're married than when you're dating. I don't care how long you've been together before you get married, once you get married the whole arguing dynamic completely changes. 'Cause when you're just dating, you know one very important thing about the arguing situation: you know you can leave with your stuff. But when you're married, there's this little thing called commitment. That means you are working this out in a minute, in a month or when you surrender.
===
When you're first in love, you cannot sleep close enough to that person you're in love with. At the beginning of the relationship, you're like, 'Come here, honey. Let's stay like this forever.' A short five years later, my wife is laying on my arm for 10 seconds too long, I'm like, 'Owwww. Get off my arm, man.'
Women think that men know how to communicate because when we meet you and start dating you, we talk a lot. Do you want to know why? Because we're trying to sleep with you. That's why. But we use all that up right away. That's why, after a month, we're like, 'Hey, do you like me? Because I'm out of material. Have I said or done anything in the last month that you like? Let me know. I'll say it again.'
===
A beautiful princess comes upon a frog in a meadow near her castle.The frog hops into the princess' lap and says, "My lady, one kiss from you, and I will turn back into the dapper, young prince that I once was, and then, my sweet, we can marry and set-up housekeeping in yon castle with my mother, where you can prepare my meals, clean my clothes, bear my children and forever be happy doing so."That night, as the princess dines on lightly sauteed frog legs, she chuckles to herself, "I don't f**kin' think so."
Guys, you ever come home after drinking beer all night, and you start peeing for like five minutes straight, and your girlfriend's like, 'Oh my God, get out of bed!'
===
After an hour of gathering up his courage, a shy guy finally approaches the hot girl at the end of the bar. "Um, would you mind if I chatted with you for a while?"She yells, "No, I won't sleep with you tonight, you pig!"Everyone in the bar stops and stares. Completely embarrassed, the guy slinks back to his table with a red face.After a few minutes, the woman walks over to him and apologizes. She smiles and says, "I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. I'm a graduate student in psychology, and I'm studying how people respond to embarrassing public situations."To which the guy responds as loudly as possible, "What do you mean $200 for a BJ?"
I know I'm getting older because the things that turn me on have changed. Like, just a few years ago, know what turned me on? Hot Latino men turned me on. Know what turns me on now? You know what turns me on now? People who act reasonably towards me.
===
Anybody get a random bitch phone call? Oh, you know what I mean. The women that found the phone number, then call it. This woman called me up, talking about, 'Look, I don't know who you is, but I found your phone number in my man's pocket. And you better not be fooling around with my man.' So I said, 'Honey, I don't know who you is either, but I'm gonna give you a little woman-to-woman advice. If you're having a problem in your relationship -- you think your man is cheating on you -- that's something you need to talk over with your man...' So I woke him up, gave him the phone and let her talk to him.
The best relationship I ever had -- I used to go out with a homeless girl. Yeah, it was great 'cause after sex, I could just drop her off anywhere.
===
If I sent a body part to every girl that dumped me, I'd just be a finger.
I wish I was black -- that way I could start dating you white girls again.
===
There is no romance without some lying. That's what romance is -- a little bit of Vaseline on the camera lens of life.
I finally got her to watch a porno with me, and I did not get the reaction I was after. Alright, I shouldn't have started her off with one that I was in -- that was a mistake.
===
I fall in love so fast. I come back after the first date, I tell my friends, 'She's unbelievable!' And they say, 'What did she do?' 'I don't know. I think she's a mammal.'
We ran out of classical music -- that's how long this wedding went on.
===
I'm 36; I play video games. Do you know how disappointed my girl is? Three o'clock in the afternoon, I'm in my underwear and socks with a headset and a microphone playing other nine-year-olds on the Internet.
After sex now is so disgusting. As soon as we're done, my girlfriend dismounts me like she's getting off a dirty bicycle, and then she just leaves the room. She won't even look at me. It's like she just had sex with a trucker for gas money.
===
Do you ever play a video game with your girl? I don't like playing because she just wants to have fun. 'Let's just have fun.' 'No, it's a ninja game. I learned technique. I've played for nine months. People know my name.' You play with your girl, they'll hit one button 87 times because they like the color on the remote -- 'Oh my God, blue! Yay!' -- and win every game.
Some of my best friends are lesbians. But one reason I can't be no lesbian -- for example, you out on a date with your man, he start getting on your nerve, you can go to the bathroom. You can get away. But if your man is a woman, she'll follow your ass right in there.
===
Sometimes, me and my wife, we'll rent an adult video 'cause we grown. We have pretty much paid our dues. And don't act like it's just us 'cause it's a billion dollar industry, so I know it ain't just me renting tapes 'cause I ain't got that kind of money. Other people are participating in this.
People say, 'How do you stay married?' And I say, 'Well, just keep going home 'cause the day you don't go home, it's pretty much over.'
===
Last night, my wife and I celebrated our fifth wedding anniversary. You know what five years is? Just long enough for me to think this one might not work out.
My wife had this whole gay military policy with her age: if I didn't ask, she wouldn't tell. And when I did ask, she would get offended. I'd be like, 'Let me ask you something -- how old are you?' 'Excuse me? Listen, let me tell you something -- I'm a woman, and a real man would not ask a woman her age. It's not about how old I am. It's about how young I make you feel. Now go in there and brush your teeth and put on your pajamas, get ready for bed.'
===
I broke up with this girl by e-mail. Is that a bad way to do it? I don't know what made her more mad -- that I did it by e-mail, or the fact that I cc'd my new girlfriend who wanted proof of the breakup.
You see those cell phones that have the little earpiece, so you don't have to hold the phone? You can't tell who's insane anymore, am I right? I'm walking down the street, some guy's looking right at me, 'Hey! I worked all day. You pick up the kids! You heard me -- do it!' 'All right, I'll do it. But I never loved you.'
===
Sue and Sally were discussing their sex lives.Sue said, "Mine's OK. We get it on every week, but it's no big adventure. How's yours?"Sally replied, "It's great ever since we got into S&M.;"Sue was surprised. "Really, Sally, I never would have guessed that you'd go for that.""Oh, sure," says Sally, "He snores while I masturbate."
What's a man's definition of safe sex?
===
I was on a blind date recently. This guy says to me, 'You know, I really like you, I want to meet your family.' I'm like, 'Well, that's cool. I've got a brother out on the island.' So I took his stupid ass out to Riker's.
I am single by the way... I know why, 'cause I'm picky. I want a guy who can throw a football and a tantrum.
===
Let her catch you doing it.
Normally, I don't go for the piercings and tattoos, but then she said to me that she got them because she's addicted to the pain. Yeah, which -- I was kind of intimidated, but kind of turned on at the same time. 'Cause y'all don't know, but I've been out of a relationship for three months now. I'm ready to have that just-out-of-prison sex.
===
A woman got married, but her husband was abusive.She got remarried and that husband ran out on her.She got married again and that husband failed in bed.Finally, she put an ad in the paper: "Looking for a man who won't abuse me, won't leave me, and won't fail me in bed."The next day, the doorbell rings. There is a man with no arms and no legs."Hello, I saw your ad in the paper," he says."Tell me a little about you.""Well, I have no arms, so I can't hit you. I have no legs, so I can't run out on you," he replies."How do I know you're good in bed?" she asks.He says, "I rang the doorbell, didn't I?"
Don't come home horny, drunk, you want to text your girl a sexy message. Look what you're typing before you send it. I didn't look; I just sent it off. She called me right back, she's like, 'Uh, what do you mean you want to "kick my puppy"?'
===
I just got dumped recently -- on e-mail. When we first started dating, the e-mails were cute. Couldn't wait to put the computer on. Subject heading was always friendly: 'Hey baby, thinking of you dot dot dot'... I would open up her e-mail and every other word was a different color. You get the dump e-mail, it's a different story -- subject heading: none.
Two couples are playing cards. John accidentally drops some cards on the floor. When he bends down under the table to pick them up, he notices that Bill's wife isn't wearing any underwear.Later, John goes into the kitchen to get some refreshments. Bill's wife follows him and asks, "Did you see anything that you liked under there?"John admits that he did. She says, "You can have it, but it will cost you $100."They decide that John should come to her house around 2 p.m. on Friday while Bill is at work.On Friday, John arrives at 2 p.m. He pays Bill's wife $100. They go to the bedroom, have sex and then John leaves.When Bill comes home at 6 p.m., he asks his wife, "Did John come by this afternoon?"Reluctantly, she replies, "Yes, he did stop by for a few minutes."Next Bill asks, "Did he give you $100?"She thinks, "Oh hell, he knows!" Finally she says, "Well, yes, he did give me $100.""Good," Bill says. "John came by the office this morning and borrowed $100 from me. He said that he would stop by our house on his way home and pay me back."
===
If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, it was, and always will be yours. If it never returns, it was never yours to begin with. If it just sits in your room, messes up your stuff, eats your food, uses your phone, takes your money, and never behaves as if you actually set it free in the first place, you either married it or gave birth to it.
John: I didn't sleep with my wife before we were married. Did you?Bob: I'm not sure. What was your wife's maiden name?
===
I told Maggie I wanted to go to a strip club. She said this to me, she goes, 'What do you want to go to a strip club for? I'll strip for you.' I was like, 'How great is that? I guess I'll just tell my friends to come over here.'
She has kind of a pessimistic attitude in the bedroom, you know. The vagina is always half-empty. Before we jump to conclusions, that's a large vagina joke.
===
My whole thing with 'Love Connection' is if don't nobody want your ass down on the street, what make you think Hollywood got something for you?
A man would come home very late and very drunk every night. His wife decides to teach him a lesson by dressing up like Satan and scaring him.When he finally stumbles across the lawn, his wife jumps out and howls like a demon.He looks at her and slurs, "You don't scare me. I'm married to your sister!"

What do men in a singles bar have in common?
They're all married.

CAN'T WE JUST BE FRIENDS?There is no way in hell I'm going to let any part of your body touch any part of mine.I JUST NEED SOME SPACE.... without you in it.DO I LOOK FAT IN THIS DRESS?We haven't had a fight in a while.I DON'T KNOW, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?I can't believe you have nothing planned.I LIKE YOU, BUT...

RIGHT THERE!Well, near there, I just want to get this over with.I'M JUST GOING OUT WITH THE GIRLS.We're gonna get drunk and make fun of you and your friends.
I hate new couples, that's what I hate; old couples I respect. You've been with somebody 10 years, I respect that. It's the new love I don't like, with all the car door open, kissing and touching and dating. 'Cause that's bullsh*t. Everybody in here knows that real love is when you don't give a damn about each other.

Dave's wife thinks that he is pushing himself too hard, so she takes him to a local strip club for his birthday.The doorman at the club greets them and says, "Hey, Dave! How are ya?" His wife is puzzled and asks if he's been to this club before. "Oh no," says Dave. "He's on my bowling team."They sit and a waitress asks Dave if he'd like his usual. His wife is becoming uncomfortable and says, "You must come here a lot for that woman to know what you drink.""No, honey, she's in the Ladies Bowling League. We share lanes with them."A stripper comes over to their table and throws her arms around Dave. "Hi, Davey," she says, "Want your usual lap dance?"Dave's wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club. Dave follows and spots her getting into a cab. Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her. His wife starts screaming at him.The cabbie turns his head and says, "Looks like you picked up a real doozy this time, Dave!"
If a guy tells you that he's a jerk, you should probably listen. 'Cause they tell you right off the bat, don't they girls? 'Listen, I'm a jerk. I'm no good for you.' What happens to us? We turn into a little kid: 'La-la-la-la! I can't hear you!'
===
I could never imagine dating someone that much younger. The gap in life experience is too great. 'Cause they're asking you questions like, 'Who do you like better: Bon Jovi or Whitesnake?' And at 33, I need to know, 'Do you own or you rent?'
This may save you some pain and some time. If you ever go out with someone who says this to you, 'I don't know why I'm not in a relationship; I have so much love to give,' you should just know that what this really means is, 'I am the black hole of emotional need and will suck the life out of you.'
===
We were dating two years. We broke up. It was a mutual decision. Her and all her friends got together -- they took a little vote.
She said, 'You're an unoriginal jerk. Everything you've said to me you've said to some other girl.' I felt awful but I was like, 'Yeah, of course.' There's only a limited amount of words in the English language that make sense to say to a female. If you can only use them once, you're going to run out and be like, 'Garbage truck banana boat.'
===
My mom says to me all the time, she goes, 'Tami, you haven't met the right guy yet because you don't wear enough lipstick or rouge.' Rouge! I'm not sure if you guys know, but this isn't even a product on the market anymore.
A man walks into a pharmacy and tells the salesgirl that he's looking for a box of tampons for his wife. She directs him to the correct aisle. A few minutes later, he deposits a huge bag of cotton balls on the counter.She says, confused, "Sir, I thought you were looking for tampons for your wife?""You see, it's like this. Yesterday, I sent my wife to the store to get me a carton of cigarettes, and she came home with a tin of tobacco and some rolling paper. So, I figure, if I have to roll my own, so does she."
===
I have a lot of friends who are getting married. I try to avoid talking to them about their sex lives now 'cause it's so depressing. One guy told me it had been six months since he had gotten to second base with his wife. Yeah, I don't know which one was more pathetic: that he used the phrase 'second base' or that he hadn't been there in six months?
I want me a big black girl.... type of woman that lies in the bed, looks like a big old hole in the sheets.
===
You're supposed to wait 'til you get married, get you a nice little ring on your finger -- a nice rock, or a pebble if he cheap, but preferably a rock. Now, come on, girls, say it with me, 'No ring, no ding-a-ling.' Come on, now -- 'No rock, no f**k.'
What's the difference between a girlfriend and a wife?

Why do brides smile while they walk down the wedding aisle?
They realize they've given their last blow jobs.

A honeymoon couple are lying in bed when the husband says, Honey, let's get busy. She replies, Wait until the spirit moves me. Five minutes later he asks again she says, Wait until the spirit moves me.Ten  minutes later, the wife says, Honey the spirit moved me. The husband replied, Let the spirit f**k you. I just jacked off
-- The spouse who snores the loudest always falls asleep first.-- The product you are most embarrassed to buy must be price-checked over the intercom.-- The heavier the load and the farther you must carry it, the more your nose itches.--The original will be found when a replacement is bought.-- When you have a deadline, the printer always runs out of toner.-- When you have to get up early, a power surge knocks out the alarm clock in the night.-- Technical instructions are in three languages: Spanish, French and Geek.-- On the verge of completing a major spreadsheet, you will mysteriously perform an "illegal operation" and erase your work.
===
When I have my money, I'm going to hire somebody to give a f**k. Wouldn't that be nice? You hire just some random dude off the street to give a f**k for you, that's his job. So your wife comes home, she's all pissed; she's like, 'You just going to spend all our money at the casino and then park your truck in my flowerbed?' I'd be like, 'You need to talk to Todd. I will leave you two alone.'
-- The smell of beer on your breath drives me wild.-- I'm bored. Let's shave the p***y.-- I've decided to stop wearing clothes around the house.-- Let's get a good porno movie, a case of beer, and make an afternoon of it.-- God, if I don't blow you soon, I swear I'm gonna bust!-- I only signed up for yoga so that I can get my ankles behind my head.-- Let's subscribe to Hustler.-- Let's take pictures so your friends will believe you.-- Honey, our neighbor's daughter is sunbathing again. Come see!-- Awesome fart! Do another one!

What are the three rings of marriage?
The engagement ring, the wedding ring and the suffering.
===
The AT&T; guy turned into a whiny bitch on the phone. I didn't know what to do. I started acting like it was a break-up. 'I'd like to discontinue my service.' 'What do you mean?' 'I don't want service anymore.' 'Three years means nothing to you?' 'It's not you. It's me. I'm in love with Verizon.'
I'm just avoiding my girlfriend. We just passed a year together, and she's testing my commitment with these questions that she learned in Cosmopolitan. And they're trick questions, you can't answer them -- 'If I was horribly disfigured in an accident, would you still love me?' Just say, 'Yes, of course,' and hope that it never really happens.
===
I was dating a woman. Before we had our first little sex talk, she actually said this to me -- she goes, 'Todd, I've had anal sex before, but, uh, don't ask me who it was with.' I think if I made a list of every question I'd ask before that one, it would be a list of every question.
People ask me all the time, 'Todd, when you're on the road at these comedy clubs, do you hit on the waitresses?' People, I'm a professional, and I have a policy. I will not hit on the wait staff until every opportunity in the audience has been exhausted.
===
You ever have sex with someone you don't know that well? They're gonna spend the night; they ask if you'll set an alarm: 'Hey can you set an alarm? I gotta wake up for work.' 'I could, but that alarm's gonna wake me up, also. They don't sell an alarm that'll only wake you up, not even at that place Brookstone. Can't you just call in sick? I really had my heart set on a really nice, awkward breakfast.'
I've been hanging out with too many couples, hanging out with the 'We agree on everything' couple. They pretend to share the most obscure opinions in the world. You'll ask them about a movie they saw, 'Hey, did you see that new Harry Potter movie?' 'Yes, we saw it.' 'Did you like it?' 'We thought the script was good, but we thought they should've used different lighting in the exterior shots.' Wow. You both walked out of the theater thinking that? That's unbelievable. I think even a married couple of lighting directors would not have an occurrence that weird. What I'm thinking happened is -- one of you said that; the other, being weak and pathetic, pretended to agree; and now we're supposed to think your two hearts beat as one.
===
Here's a big thing if you're dating or in a relationship: for God's sake, communicate with one another. It's so essential to any good relationship. Let me tell you what happened in my relationship. Six months into the relationship, I find out she only speaks Spanish.
I just broke up with this girl, and she was really into sex games. Like, there was this one she used to like to play all the time -- it was called 'Sleep With My Friend Rob.'
===
Who's bigger, Mr. Bigger or his baby?
The baby -- he's a little Bigger.
===
I can't have kids because I have white couches.
My best friend just had her third child. She'll be sterilized by the state soon.
===
I don't like people who have babies and act like they did something that the rest of us can't figure out. Anybody can have one, OK? I could have had three if I had gone through with any of my pregnancies.
Having a baby is a huge responsibility. It's like a five-year commitment.
===
He's so pissed off 'cause he probably thought he was, like, scoring the biggest deal of his lifetime, getting adopted by this famous movie star, who was gonna rescue him from his third world Cambodia, only to find out she's gonna take him to every other f**king third world country in the world. He's probably like, 'When the f**k are we getting to Malibu like you promised?'
When I was a little girl, I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm gonna wait 'til I go to college to lose my virginity,' and all these big dreams. Then, the third grade ended up being such a nutty year -- and I'm so glad I didn't wait for college 'cause I didn't end up getting accepted anywhere.
===
Somebody bought me a Snuggie as a joke gift. Haha, the joke's on you, I enjoy it. I toss and turn at night, finally a blanket that's like, 'I'm going to keep you warm.' It's like having a small child with polio keep you in a full nelson -- the perfect pressure.
It was actually very strange growing up because both my parents are actors, so they were always worried that we wouldn't create a scene.

I told my daughter she shouldn't drink alcohol at a young age because drunk ass Maurice painted our kitchen, our living room and our dining room for half a bottle of wine. I was able to teach her two lessons: one was the evils of alcohol and two was how to take advantage of your opponent's weakness.
I just had a birthday. My buddies all took me out. One of them pipes up, out of nowhere, he's like, 'You know, out of all of us, D, you're the only one, man, who does not have any kids. I said, 'Ha-ha-ha-ha, yeah!' And the other one said, 'What's your secret?' 'Condoms.' You know what he says? 'I don't wear rubbers, man. You can't feel nothing with a condom on.' Alright, try it with half your paycheck missing -- you'll feel that.
===
My parents told me they were going to sell me to the gypsies. Oh, thanks, like, 'If you don't do your homework, we're going to sell you to the gypsies. If you don't eat all your food, we're going to sell you to the gypsies.' What sort of terrible business are the gypsies running when they're taking malnourished dumb kids?
American teenagers are six times more likely to get pregnant than French teenagers. And what does that tell you? It tells you that American teenagers are better looking. But I say, let's learn from the French -- don't hand out condoms to high school students, take away their deodorant.
===
The average teenager watches six hours of television every day. At least with drugs, you're out -- you're singing, you're dancing. You're meeting people. You're breaking into homes. You're networking.
Four expectant fathers pace in a hospital waiting room while their wives are in labor. The nurse enters and tells the first man, "Congratulations, you're the father of twins.""What a coincidence," the man says. "I work for the Minnesota Twins baseball team."A little later, the nurse returns and tells the second man, "You are the father of triplets.""That's really an incredible coincidence," he answers. "I work for the 3M Corporation."An hour later, the nurse tells the third man that his wife has just given birth to quadruplets.The man says, "I don't believe it! I work for the Four Seasons. What a coincidence."After hearing this, everyone's attention turns to the fourth guy who has just fainted. He slowly regains consciousness and whispers, "I should have never taken that job at Millennium Computers."

One day, a  little boy wrote to Santa Clause, "Please send me a sister."Santa Clause wrote him back, "Ok, send me your mother."
We were watching this commercial on television. Commercial said, 'If you're having problems with your mama whipping you, call this 800 number.' I called that number. My mama answered the phone.

Wilfred had just learned his ABCs and was very scared of reciting them in front of his class.  He stood in front of the class trembling and began."A B C D E F G H I J L K M N O Q R S T U V W X Y Z."His teacher said, "Very good, Wilfred. But you forgot the P. Where's the P?He replied, "It's running down my leg."
My favorite part about our four-year-old son is when he wakes up in the morning, he comes to the side of our bed, he looks me right in the eye and says, 'I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND ANYMORE!'
===
His teacher said it was a piece of cake.
Teaching wasn't that bad -- except for the kids.
===
My cousins were all bigger than me, so they would take the army guys in the cool positions. So, the only dude I had left was the dude on the phone. So really, my army just looked like 10 gay guys waiting on their lattes at Starbucks.
You grow up real quick, a half-Mexican in a sailor's suit, because I'd be riding the streetcar to school everyday -- minding my own business, humming out a 'Frere Jacques' -- and I realized that in any other town, this might be considered cute. But you know what it is in San Francisco? Sexy.
===
My son comes out of his room wearing these flood pants with holes in both knees. I have no idea where he found these pants. And I go, 'Dude, you gotta change your pants. You can't wear those pants.' He goes, 'I like these pants, these are my favorite pants, I'm gonna wear them.' I didn't know what to say, I'm a young dad, so I go, 'You're gonna be embarrassed.' He looks at me, steps to me a little bit, and goes, 'I'm not gonna be embarrassed. They're your friends. You're gonna be embarrassed.' I was like, 'Son of a bitch.'
I am half-black, half-Puerto Rican, which is messed up 'cause you know I was born a suspect. You know anytime something went wrong, they blamed the spigger.
===
I don't get out that much now that I've become a single father. Let me just use this opportunity to just warn some of the guys in the audience: when you're out drinking, just use moderation, take it easy. Seriously, all it takes is one irresponsible night when you get drunk and you stumble into an adoption agency.
I was adopted by Swedish people in Minnesota. I don't know what your excuse for being all screwed up is, but that would be mine. My parents are Jan and Harold Anderson of Excelsior, Minnesota. It's kind of like being raised by wolves, except for they're white people.
===
I have an excuse, actually, why I've been drinking so much. I haven't said this out loud yet -- this is exciting -- I'm drinking for two. Thank you, wow. I mean, just for now. Somebody's being evicted.
There's nothing more awkward than going to the first birthday party of a little girl when you told her mom to get rid of her -- because the kid can tell.
===
I'll never forget how she told us. She took us all out to brunch, and she was like, 'You guys, I'm keeping this one.'
The girls I grew up with they're living normal, adult lives. So they call me now and they're like, 'Amy, I'm pregnant.' And I still react like, 'What are you going to do? I'll drive you, I guess.'
===
We were kids living in Hong Kong. How cool is that? Think about that for a second -- everything you were playing with was made here, right here. They have it in stock.
I was in Philadelphia -- a very angry town, Philadelphia. I've never seen a town like this. It's supposed to be the City of Brotherly Love -- like when my brother was 12 and I was nine, and he would lean on my shoulder and dangle spit in my face.
===
Simply show them pictures of what we used to wear in the 60s and 70s, 'You see this shirt with the collar going all the way down to the elbow? This is what happens when you take drugs.'
About a month ago some kids in my neighborhood were playing hide-and-go-seek and one of them ended up in an abandoned refrigerator. It's all anybody talked about for weeks. I said, 'Who cares? How many kids you know get to die a winner?'
===
I've got a kid in Africa that I feed, that I clothe, that I school, that I inoculate for 75 cents a day. Which is practically nothing compared to what it cost to send him there.
My sister just had a baby, a little newborn. The kid is adorable, so cute. She wouldn't let me hold him, she refuses. She says, 'No way, Anthony, I'm afraid you're gonna drop him.' I'm 32 years old. Like I'm some kind of idiot. Like I don't have a million other ways to hurt that baby.
===
Never give up, because your dreams can come true. Take me, for example: when I was a kid, I really wanted to be invisible. So then, I grew up, and I moved to L.A.
That's how you know you grew up in a ghetto house -- you'll be saying stuff like, 'My sister's daddy's cool.'
===
Why is Tigger always so dirty?
He's always playing with Pooh.
===
Kids get to walk in a room and express their opinions now. When we was growing up, if grown folk was in there talking, you couldn't say s**t. 'Shut up! There's grown folk in here talking.' 'I just wanna let you grown folk know: The house is on fire.'
White folks, y'all got a child that's kind of slow, y'all send him to a special school. Black folks won't even admit there's anything wrong with their child. 'Get your crazy ass in this house. Ain't nothing wrong with that boy. He always wears a football helmet and cowboy boots.'
===
The whole argument is -- when does life begin? Does it begin at conception, or does it begin when the baby is an embryo? Anybody with children knows life with them don't begin 'til they can pay their own damn bills.
I just joined the Big Brother program recently. The very first question that lady asked me over the phone was, 'Well what race do you want him to be?' So just to mess with her, I said, 'I don't care what race he is, just so long as when I pick him up, he's wearing something sexy.'
===
We never went to Toys 'R' Us, we always went to f**king Auschwitz for kids -- Home Depot.
If you need a baby that bad, go down to the pound and get one. Not even a baby -- go get an old man. There's unwanted people of all ages, pre-made and waiting for you.
===
I was about 14, my dad caught me drinking. I said 'Dad, that's the first time.' He said, 'That's a lie -- no one ever gets caught the first time.' So that day, I robbed a bank.
We didn't have brakes. If you wanted to slow down, you skated on grass, that's how you slowed down. If you wanted to stop, you'd head toward a tree.
===
I'm sitting there, and these big fat white ladies are making out with these little tiny black guys, practically sucking their whole heads down their throat, feeling up their boobs and everything. I'm six... my grandmother's like, 'Susan, don't stare!' I'm like, 'Then don't take me to jail, ya's nutbag!'
I read an article in New York Magazine that women 49 years old are now having their first child. I can't get off the couch at 33 to do things for myself.
===
What's the advantage of having a kid at 49? You can both be in diapers at the same time?
And now I'm getting older, so my mom wants grandchildren. I said, 'Mom, go for it.'
===
They show these commercials in always the same happy, optimistic mood, like women are all looking for the good news they're pregnant.
You do comedy when you're like me. When you're Swedish and black, and you look like a Puerco Rican, and you mom's a Jehovah's Witness, who loves country western music, sends your black and white ass to an Irish Catholic school -- you've got some problems, right guys?
===
Why is six afraid of seven?
Because seven ate nine.

A young female teacher was giving an assignment to her 6th grade class one day. It was a large assignment so she started writing high up on the chalkboard. Suddenly there was a giggle from one of the boys in the class.   She quickly turned and asked, "What's so funny, Pat?""I just saw one of your garters!""Get out of my classroom," she yells, "I don't want to see  you for three days!"The teacher turns back to the chalkboard. Realizing she had forgotten to title theassignment, she reaches to the very top of the chalkboard.  Suddenly there is an even louder giggle from another male student. She quickly turns and asks, "What's so funny, Billy?""I just saw both of your garters!"Again, she yells, "Get out of my classroom! This time the punishment is more severe,  I don't want to see you for three weeks!"Embarrassed and frustrated, she drops the eraser when she turns around again. So she bends over to pick it up. This time there is an burst of laughter from another male student.  She quickly turns to see Little Johnny leaving the classroom."Where do you think you're going?" she asks."From what I just saw, my school days are over!"
One day, a little boy asks his father what  the difference is between 'technically' and   'reality.'"Son, I won't tell you the dictionary definition in fear that   it will confuse you. But to help you out, I'll give you something to do. Go ask your mother if   she will sleep with a bum for $500,000 and ask your sister is she'll sleep with the garbageman for the same amount."  So, the little boy goes up to his mom."Mommy, would you ever sleep with a bum for $500,000?""You bet your ass I would!" exclaims the mother.  So the little boy goes up to his sister's   bedroom."Hey sis, would you sleep with the garbageman for $500,000?""I sure would!" exclaims his sister."Dad, Dad! Mom and sis both said they would. What does that mean?""Well, son," the father says. "Technically, we're millionares but in reality we live with a couple of dirty whores!"

Your dad's a wanker.
One day a teacher told her students to draw a train on a railway track for homework. The next day when the teacher started checking everybody's book, she came up to Little Johnny. "Show me the homework," she demanded. Little Johnny showed the teacher his notebook with only a picture of railroad tracks. The teacher asked, "Where is the train?" Little Johnny then replied, "You came late so the train went away."

One day a man goes to a pet shop to buy a parrot.   The assistant takes the man to the parrot section and asks the man to choose one. The man asks, ''How much  is the yellow one?''     The assistant says, ''$2000.''    The man is shocked and asks the assistant why it's so expensive. The assistant explains, ''This parrot is a very special one. He knows typewriting and can type really fast.''''What about the green one?'' the man asks.The assistant says, ''He costs $5000 because he knows typewriting and can answer incoming telephone calls and takes notes.''''What about the red one?'' the man asks.The assistant says, ''That one's $10,000.''The man says, ''What does HE do?''The assistant says, ''I don't know, but the other two call him boss.''
I was babysitting a couple of weeks ago -- OK, I wasn't babysitting. I was trying to sleep with this woman. She was babysitting, so that automatically made me her assistant. And, you know, of course you gotta put the kids to sleep. We tried everything: I smoked blunts in their faces, I gave them Hennessy -- nothing worked.
===
She calls me up in the middle of the night. She says to me, 'Tracy, I can't believe that I actually have a person inside of me.' I said, 'So do I. I'll call you back.'

Two boys are playing by a stream when they spy a woman bathing nude around the bend. One of the boys takes off running in the opposite direction. The other boy chases after him and asks why he took off."Well," the boy says, "my mom told me that if I ever spied on a naked lady, I'd turn to stone, and I felt something getting hard!"
I'm from Chicago, but I pay child support in Seattle. I'm just kidding -- I don't pay child support.

A little kid goes to his first movie alone. He buys one ticket and goes in.A minute later, he comes back out to buy another ticket. The man at the counter asks, "Why do you want another one?"The kid replies, "Because that man over there ripped the first one in half."
I know there are a lot of wonderful adopted children, but they're not on the Jerry Springer show, OK? And that's the show that I watch.
===
I saw this little girl -- she had sweatpants on that had the word 'Juicy' written across her ass, like, right across her ass. She was, like, seven years old, walking with her father. I think any father that allows their seven-year-old daughter to wear sweatpants with the word 'Juicy' written across her ass should be put in prison for child endangerment. And his orange jumpsuit should have the word 'Juicy' written right across the ass.
I told my kids, 'Look, you guys, if someone comes up to you at school and says, "Is your mom gay?" Look them square in the face and go, "Why? Does your mom want to date her?"'
===
I know how to get sisters. I got 30 years practicing that. All you got to do is go to the club and say, 'I got that rent money.'
I love black women: burnt black, slave black. I love my woman so black, I just like her to lay in the bed, look like a hole in the sheets.
===
I got a boy that was married, been married for six years -- videotaped his wedding day, never watched it. Six years later, now he watches it every day, but he watches it in reverse. I asked him. He said, 'I love seeing myself take that ring back off her f**kin' finger.'
I was going to get me a white woman, but O.J. messed it up for everybody. He set interracial dating back a thousand years.
===
I missed the 70s. That's what I hear, that it was one big ski weekend. From what I hear, this was a good pick-up line in the 1970s: 'Come on, let's go.'
She woke me up in the middle of the night one time. She goes, 'Wake up, I think we have a ghost.' 'Oh alright, I'll just strap the vacuum to my back and go check it out.'
===
I answer personal ads. I'm not ashamed to admit it. But I think I'm the only one that answers them in the negative. Like, I'll call up and be like, 'Yeah, are you a single, white female, 29, who likes long walks on the beach, poetry and jazz? I'm not interested in that.'
He took me to McDonald's, backed his car through the drive-through window, so the cashier could be on my side.

Ladies ask the craziest things. My last girlfriend, all quiet, she turned to me and would be like, 'Would you still love me if I weighed 500 lbs?' I was like, 'Why -- is that one of your goals?'
Dating in the city, I see a whole lot of this new phenomenon. Have you guys seen this? I get the black boy that wants to be white and the white boy that wants to be black. My choices are Tiger Woods and Eminem. How'd that happen?
===
I'm not good at drinking; I just become another person. Like last year, I went out drinking, and I met this girl and she gave me her number, but the next day I didn't even want to call her. I didn't feel like she met me, I felt like she met 'Two-Drink Mike.' It's totally different. Two-Drink Mike enjoys dancing and knows a magic trick. Zero-Drink Mike enjoys biographies and has serious opinions about wildlife.
Love is powerful stuff, man. Love will make you move all the way across the country and sell all your sh*t -- just to get away from that person.
===
White women want to understand sh*t. Black women, they don't have to know anything. All they have to know is something isn't right.
My friends'll ask me if I get a lot of girls because of comedy. That insinuates I get so many girls, I've gotta categorize them. Like, I got these girls because of comedy, I got these girls because I'm rich, and I got these girls because I look like Harry Potter.
===
I was married at one time -- which is not the same as having sex, but an incredible simulation.
We would go to midget parties four nights a week. OK, wait -- they weren't called 'midget parties' 'cause that's not politically correct. But c'mon, if you go to a party and there's, like, 200 midgets there -- in your mind, it's a midget party. So I don't offend anybody, we're just gonna call it a 'little get together.'
===
If you're black in America, you're relatively well-spoken, well-dressed, well-educated, sooner or later you can count on one of your white contemporaries -- with the very best of intentions -- turning to you and saying something along the lines of, 'You know what? You are so damn cool. Sometimes, I actually have trouble remembering that you're black. No, I mean that. Sometimes I really forget that you're black.' Yeah, well, let me marry your sister, and I'm sure it will pop right back into your mind.
I'm 34 years old. I thought I'd be divorced by now.
===
You hit your 30s and you're still single, you'll look around and feel like you missed out on the first round draft picks. That guy who couldn't dance now looks awfully cute carrying a diaper bag. Now we gotta wait for trading season.
I was going through men like they were freakin' Kleenex. I was like, 'Woohoo! You're too tall and you can't dance and I don't like the pleats in your pants. La la la la la la la.' The next thing you know -- you're 30 years old, and your Kleenex is empty, and you are digging through the trash for the wad you haven't used up yet. Where's the guy who liked me too much? Where's the one who was too nice? Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
===
My parents are divorced. I'm just kidding -- I'm black, they were never married.
Now that I'm grown, I'm scared 'cause I'm thinking Lois is gonna get half of those powers when they get divorced. And you can't be Superman then, you know. It's like, 'Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound -- every other weekend.'
===
I used to want to meet a guy that was kind, warm, loving; now, I'm happy if the guy has ears -- not that he'll listen, but that he can.
I've tried this online dating thing, and it's so weird. The worst thing about online dating is everybody puts the same hobbies down. You know what the most popular hobby in New York City is? Hiking and biking. We live in New York -- where the f**k do you hike? Are you, like, rappelling down the side of your building in the morning?
===
My husband's so macho, he has five guns, a helicopter, a motorcycle; he used to be on a SWAT team; and he works the cattle at his mom's farm. So, I thought, he's either really macho, or he's really gay and he's overcompensating. He likes to clean the house and vacuum, so I think he's really gay. But I'm just gonna enjoy him 'til he comes out of the closet.
When I first called up my high school sweetheart, I hadn't seen him for 12 years, and I found out that he had become a cop. And I thought, 'Oh, cops are so brave! They're heroes and protect us from bad people and risk their lives!' Then I met them all, and I found out they go to Hooters.

A guy walks into a bar and asks for a beer. He chugs it, looks into his pocket and asks for another beer. He chugs that beer, looks into his pocket and asks for another.The man does this a few more times until the bartender asks, "How come you ask for a beer, chug it, then look in your pocket?"The man says, "Because there is a picture of my wife in my pocket and I'm gonna keep drinking till she looks good enough for me to go home."
===
You know when a relationship goes bad, man. You can tell when it goes bad when the sexual fantasies start getting all dark and everything. I was in this relationship, and he was like, 'Come on, come on -- what's your fantasy?' And I was like, 'Well, I woke up, and you were dead.'
He used to give me one rose, too. Watch out for the one rose givers. He used to say, 'This is one rose for you because you are one special lady.' Yeah, I fell for that mess. After a while, I was like, 'No, no, no, no -- this is one rose because you are one cheap bastard -- that's what THIS is.'
===
Whenever we go out, I pay all the tolls. Yeah -- he backs up to the tolls so the booth would be on my side.
There's nothing wrong with dating younger men. My husband and I, we get along except for music because music dates you. He loves hip-hop -- that's his thing, he loves rap music -- but I like jazz. But he's started to enjoy jazz because I like to listen to jazz while we're having sex. Yeah, right, so now he LOVES jazz because he associates it with sex. He hears that jazz, he's like, 'That's my cue! It's on now!' But now, I can't even enjoy my music. I'm listening to Miles Davis, washing dishes. I turn around, he's standing there butt naked: 'Did ya call me?'

A groom waits at the altar with a huge smile on his face. His best man asks, "Why do you look so excited?"The groom replies, "I just had the best blow job I have ever had in my entire life, and I am marrying the wonderful woman who gave it to me."The bride waits at the other end of the aisle with a huge smile on her face. Her maid of honor asks, "Why do you look so excited?"The bride replies, "I just gave the last blow job of my entire life."

When they finish, the husband gets up and walks to the telephone. "What are you doing?" asks the wife."I'm hungry. I'm calling room service.""Tiger wouldn't do that.""Oh yeah? What would Tiger do?""He'd come back to bed and do it a second time."The husband drops the phone and makes love to his wife a second time. When they finish, he goes back to the phone."What are you doing now?" she asks."I'm still hungry, so I'm going to ring room service for some food.""Tiger wouldn't do that.""Oh yeah? What would Tiger do?""He'd come back to bed and do it one more time."The husband puts the phone down and heads back to bed.Exhausted after the third lovemaking session, he shuffles back to the phone and starts to dial.The wife asks, "Are you calling room service?""No!

The first woman says, "Last night my husband said he was going to his office, but when I called they said he wasn't there!""I know!" the next woman says, "Last night my husband said he was going to his brother's house, but when I called he wasn't there."The third woman says, "I always know where my husband is.""Impossible!" both women exclaim, "He has you completely fooled!""Oh no," says the woman. "I'm a widow."

An old couple celebrates their 50th wedding anniversary in a honeymoon suite. All night long, the bellboy hears laughing and clapping sounds from their room.The next morning, he asks the old man how he can do it all night at his age.The husband replies, "First, I remove my clothes. Then, I lie down on the bed face up. Then, my wife removes her clothes and  lifts up my penis with one hand, and we make a bet. If it falls to left when she lets go, I win; if it falls to right, she wins."The bell boy asks, "Well, what if it doesn't fall?""Then we both win," says the old man.

A doctor tells a group of patients, "The material we put into our stomachs is terrible. Red meat is awful. Soft drinks corrode your stomach lining. Chinese food is loaded with MSG. High-fat diets can be  disastrous, and none of us realizes the long-term harm caused by the germs in our drinking water. But there is one thing that is the most  dangerous of all. Can anyone here tell me what food it is that causes the most grief and suffering for years after eating it?"  An old man raises his hand and says, "Wedding cake."

An alien walked into a shop and told the owner that he came from Mars and wanted to buy a brain for research.''How much is this one?'' he asked. ''That one is a monkey brain, and it's $20,'' the owner explained.''How much is that one?'' the alien asked.  "That one is a female brain, and it's $100,'' the owner replied.''And how much is that one?'' the alien asked. ''That one is a male's brain and it is $500'' the owner explained.''Why so expensive?'' the alien asked.   The owner answered,''Well, it's hardly been used!''

Oh man, I get a lot of junk email. Isn't it annoying? Clutters everything up. I'm starting to sense a theme, though. Apparently, there's a lot of people out there that want to make my penis three inches longer.
I was over there in Hawaii. I was there on the big island. The 'Big Island' -- that name cracks me up. First of all, it's not that big, so I'm pretty sure a guy came up with that name.

Men have a lot of good qualities, but combining rage and information ain't one. We can't talk to people when we're pissed. That's how championship wrestling got started.
I was watching this thing the other day on hermaphrodites. And I was always under the impression that there were only maybe, like, a handful of them... but there are tons of them. They're everywhere, which makes me a lot more skeptical when I see guys buying tampons.
===
I wish I had a designated black person to follow me around and say the stuff I want to say, but I can't. Because black people don't have filters; they just say it. Imagine that: I'm breaking up with a girl, 'You know comedy's getting real tough right now; it's getting real hard for me. I just can't do it.' The black guy comes out of nowhere -- he's like, 'Bitch, you ugly. That's what he was trying to say, but he ain't black.'
I started dating this new girl. At the beginning of the relationship she tells me, 'You got to wait at least a month before you get the cookie.' I was like, 'Alright, whatever.' So I called her a month later.

Normal.
On a beautiful deserted island in the middle of nowhere, the following people are stranded:   2 Italian men and 1 Italian woman, 2 French men and 1 French woman, 2 German men and 1 German woman, 2 Greek men and 1 Greek woman, 2 English men and 1 English woman, 2 Polish men and 1 Polish woman, 2 Japanese men and 1 Japanese woman, 2 Australian men and 1 Australian woman, 2 New Zealander men and 1 New Zealander woman, 2 Irish men and 1 Irish woman, 2 American men and 1 American woman.   One month later, the following things have occurred....One Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman.  The two French men and the French woman are living happily together, having loads of sex. The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of when they alternate with the German woman.  The two Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them.  The two English men are waiting for someone to introduce them to the English woman. The Polish men took a long look at the endless ocean and one look at the Polish woman and they started swimming.  The two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo and are waiting for instructions.  The two Australian men beat each other senseless fighting  over the Australian woman, who called them both bloody wankers and is checking out all the other men.Both New Zealand men are searching the island for sheep. The Irish began by dividing the island into North and South  and setting up a distillery. They do not remember if sex is in the picture because it gets sort of foggy after the first few liters of coconut whiskey, but they are satisfied in that at least the English are not getting any.    The American woman keeps on bitching about her body being her own, the true nature of feminism, how she can do everything that they can do, about the necessity  of fulfillment, the equal division of household chores, how her last boyfriend respected her opinions and treated her much nicer and how her relationship with her mother is mproving. The two American men have committed suicide.

For some reason I decided to play the game of probability and choose the letter "A" for everything.

"Can you explain why you chose an 'A' for everything?"Knowing that there was nothing I could do at this point, I said, "Well, I've always wanted to be an 'A' student."

Write a program that plays the "Pokemon" theme song and play it at the highest volume possible over and over again. Work normally for a while.  Suddenly look amazingly startled by something on the screen and crawl underneath the desk. Ask the person next to you if they know how to tap into top-secret Pentagon files. Use AIM to make passes at people you don't know. Make a small ritual sacrifice to the computer before you turn it on. Bring a chainsaw, but don't use it.  If anyone asks why you have it, say, "Just in case..." mysteriously. Type on VAX for awhile.  Suddenly start cursing for 3 minutes about everything bad about your life.  Then stop and continue typing. Enter the lab, undress, and start staring at other people as if they're crazy while typing. Light candles in a pentagram around your terminal before starting. Ask around for a spare zip disk.  Offer $1.  Keep asking until someone agrees.  Then, pull a disk out of your fly and say, "Oops. Forgot." Every time you press return and there is processing time required, pray, "Ohpleaseohpleaseohpleaseohpleaseohplease," and scream "YES!" when itfinishes. "Disk fight!" Start making out with the person at the terminal next to you, whether you know them or not. Put a straw in your mouth and put your hands in your pockets.  Type by hitting the keys with the straw. If you're sitting in a swivel chair, spin around singing "The Thong Song" whenever there is processing time required. Draw a picture of a woman (or man) on a piece of paper and tape it toyour monitor.  Try to seduce it.  Act like it hates you and thencomplain loudly that women (men) are worthless. Try to stick a Nintendo cartridge in the disk drive.  When it doesn't work, get the supervisor. When you start up a PC, ask loudly where the smiling Apple face is. Print out the complete works of Shakespeare, then when it's all done (two days later) say that all you wanted was a line or two. Sit and stare at the screen, chomping on your nails.  After doingthis for a while, spit them out at the feet of the person next to you. Stare at the screen, grind your teeth, stop, look at the person next to you.  Repeat procedure, making sure you never provoke the person enough to let them blow up, as this releases tension, and it is far more  effective to let them linger. If you have long hair, take a typing break, look for split ends, cut  them, and deposit them on your neighbor's keyboard as you leave. Put a large, gold-framed portrait of the British royal family on your desk and loudly proclaim that it inspires you. Come to the lab wearing several layers of socks.  Remove shoes and placethem on top of the monitor.  Remove socks layer by layer and drape themaround the monitor. Exclaim sudden haiku about the aesthetic beauty ofcotton on plastic.Take the keyboard and sit under the computer.  Type up your paper likethis.  Then go to the lab supervisor and complain about the bad working  conditions. Laugh hysterically, shout "You will all perish in a great flood" and continue working. Bring some dry ice and make it look like the computer is smoking. Assign a musical note to every key (ex. the delete key is A flat).Whenever you hit a key, hum its note loudly.  Write an entire paper thisway. Attempt to eat your computer mouse. Borrow someone else's keyboard by reaching over, saying "Excuse me, mindif I borrow this for a sec?" unplugging the keyboard, and taking it. Bring in a bunch of magnets and have a ball. When doing calculations, pull out an abacus and say that sometimes theold ways are best. Play Pong for hours on the most powerful computer in the lab. Make a loud noise of hitting the same key over and over again until yousee that your neighbor is noticing.  Then look at your neighbor's keyboard.  Hithis/her delete key several times, erasing an entire word.  While you dothis, ask: "Does your delete key work?"  Shake your head, and resumehitting the space bar on your keyboard.  Keep doing this until you'vedeleted about a page of your neighbor's document.  Then, suddenlyexclaim:  "Well, whaddya know?  I've been hitting the space bar thiswhole time.  No wonder it wasn't deleting!  Ha!"  Print out yourdocument and leave. Remove your disk from the drive and hide it.  Go to the lab monitor and complain that your computer ate your disk.  (For special effects, put some glue on or around the disk drive.  Claim that the computer is drooling.) Stare at your neighbor's screen, look really puzzled, burstout laughing and say "You did that?" loudly.  Keep laughing, grab yourstuff and leave, howling as you go. Point at the screen. Chant in a made-up language while making elaboratehand gestures for a minute or two.  Press return or the mouse, then leapback and yell, "COVEEEEERRRRR!"  Peek up from under the table, walk backto the computer and say "Oh, good.  It worked this time," and calmlystart to type again. Keep looking at invisible bugs and trying to swat them. See who's online. Send a total stranger a talk request.  Talk to themlike you've known them all your lives.  Hang up before they get a chanceto figure out you're a total stranger. Bring a small tape player with a tape of really absurd sound effects. Pretend it's the computer and look really lost. Pull out a pencil.  Start writing on the screen.  Complain that the lead doesn't work. Come into the computer lab wearing several extra-stinky species of flowers in your hair.  Smile incessantly.  Type a sentence, then laugh happily exclaim, "You're such a marvel!" and kiss the screen.  Repeat this after every sentence.  As your ecstasy mounts, also hug the keyboard. Finally, hug your neighbor, the computer assistant, and then walk out. Run into the computer lab, shout, "The Apocalypse is here!" then calmly sit down and begin to type. Quietly walk into the computer lab with a Black and Decker chainsaw, rev 'er up, and then walk up to the nearest person and say, "Give me that computer or you'll be feeding my pet crocodile for the next week." Two words: Tesla Coil.

A man is in court for murder and the judge says, "You are charged with beating your wife to death with a hammer."   A voice at the back of the court says, "You bastard."   The judge continues, "You are also charged with beating your daughter to death with a hammer." Again the voice at the back of the court says, "You bastard."  The judge says, "We cannot have any more of these outbursts from you. What is the problem?"  The man at the back of the court says, "Fifteen years I lived next door to that bastard,   and every time I asked to borrow a hammer, he said he didn't have one!"

Bill Clinton is out jogging around in some of   the seedier areas of Washington D.C.  He notices   a good looking prostitute.  She sees him and   calls out, Fifty dollars!   He's tempted, but the price is a little high so   he calls back, Five! She's disgusted and turns   away while Bill continues his jog.     A few days later, he finds himself jogging in   the same area and as luck would have it, the   prostitute is still there.  But she won't come   down on her price.  Fifty! she shouts.  Bill answers her, Five!   No sale.    About a week later, Hillary has decided that she   wants to get into shape so she demands to go   jogging with Bill.  They get to the seedy part   of town and the same prostitute is still there.   She eyes Bill and Hillary together and yells,   See what you get for five dollars!

They're rather slow, aren't they?" the doctor asks.The groundskeeper tells them that the other golfers are a group of blind firefighters who lost their sight saving the clubhouse from a fire and that they come and play for free whenever they want.The group is silent for a moment.The pastor says, "That's so sad. I will say a special prayer for them tonight."The doctor says, "Good idea. I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them."The engineer says, "Why can't these guys play at night?"

A secretary goes to the company stockroom and requisitions a box of pens. The clerk fumbles around for a bit and then hands her a box of ballpoints.    The secretary returns to her desk, takes out a new pen and begins to write. The pen skips and then stops giving out any ink. Frustrated, she tries another pen and then another and another. None of them work.    Returning to the stockroom, she slams down the box of defective pens and demands, "Why did you give me a box of pens that don't work?"    The clerk answers, "Well, somebody has to use them!"

When I travel, I like to take care of myself; I like to stay in fancy places. So, I always stay at the Super 8 Motel. That is a very fancy place. You can tell it's fancy because it has the word 'super' right in the name.
A couple of weeks ago I got a call -- typical telemarketer. He said, 'Are you happy with your long distance service?' And I said, 'Now this is an insane coincidence.' And he said, 'What?' And I said, 'I also work for a long distance phone company.' And he was like, 'Really?' And I said, 'Yeah.' And we laughed and we laughed at what a coincidence that was, and then I said, 'Well, look, while I got you on phone -- are you happy with your long distance service? Because I've got a calling plan that could just shave dollars off your monthly bill.'

I'm at a very frustrating point in my career because I'm not a millionaire. Like, people assume because you're in movies or TV, you're rich. I'm not rich, but I'm far from broke. I'm what you call a 'thousandaire.'
I had to buy a new printer the other day. The printer I wanted was like $200, but for some reason, I figured out that if I bought a printer/copier/scanner/faxer/coffee maker/clay oven/tennis racquet restringer, it's like $8.95. And I had to ask myself: why would it be that by paying less, I get more? How is it that the less I pay, the more I get? And I've figured out there's only one logical answer -- the giant, multinational, megacorporations really just want me to be happy. That's the only possible answer.

I'm thinking of switching banks, and my friend said, 'Well, what's wrong with Citibank?' Well, they can't spell 'city.' I hope their math is better than their English is.
One thing I have realized, though, in life in general -- much better to hang out with your poor friends as opposed to your rich friends. 'Cause rich people, they're just gone. They have no idea what things cost anymore. I went out to dinner with some very wealthy friends of mine -- they're just clueless. They're like, 'Hey Avi, you know for another $20, you can get a slice of shiitake mushroom on that. Totally worth it!'

I have to go home this weekend for my mother's 60th birthday party, and I am broke. Now, I know it's bad because I have the same amount of money now that I had when I was 12. And I'm really afraid that I'm going to have to make her present -- which is no longer cute or funny, is it?

So I go back to the tampon aisle to try to figure out what size she wears. And it's not like a guy can take an educated guess 'cause it's not like they come in normal human being Earth sizes -- like small, medium or large -- where a guy can go: 'That's my gal!' You know, they come in these goofy girly sizes only you ladies can figure out: regular, slim, super slim, extra crispy, new and improved.
You could pick out a Bozo costume for a guy and tell him how great his butt looks in the big red and white stripes, and he'll wear it: 'You're right, it looks good. Maybe I'll get the big shoes and the hair.'

One fine day in the middle of class at school, a girl raised her asking to be excused: Teacher, can I answer the call of nature? Knowing what the kid wanted, the teacher said okay.

Another girl was shocked by how she could actually take care of business so quickly, and asked how she managed to do it so fact.The girl responded, It was a prank call.

I love performing in Manhattan. I've been trying to get an apartment here for two years. They won't let me in. I mean, I knew it would be expensive, but I just assumed that for $2,000 a month, the toilet would be inside the apartment.

What do you come out on the news saying? 'We want to be treated like equals in the workplace.' No you don't. You want to be treated like a woman in the workplace, and you want to get paid like an equal. That's what you want. Because when men treat you like equals, what do you do? You send us to sensitivity training, bitch. That's what you do.

A cheap tourist in a Mexican town known for prostitution picks up a hooker.After paying her, he drives off, shouting back, "El dollar, counterfeito!"The prostitute smiles and shouts back, "El syphilis, originale!" 
We all know that men and women think differently. I know when I'm having sex with a woman, she's thinking about love and marriage and romance, and I'm thinking, 'A hundred bucks? I can't afford this.'

Gas is so expensive now, whenever I fill up my tank, I just whip out my d**k and jerk off right at the gas station. That's what I do. If I fill it up, I jerk it off. You know why? Cause when I spend that type of money, I'm used to cumming.

They'll be like, 'Yo, run that money. We know you got money, run your pockets. Yeah, tell your brother Marlon to come through, let me rob him, too!'
Some business ideas are horrible. They have iPod vending machines now; I saw another one at the mall. This is not a good idea. I get mad when the candy machine takes my dollar. If the iPod machine takes a couple hundred of my dollars, I'm not going to get mad -- I'm going to get my iPod and every other iPod that machine has to offer.

I assume the only reason we have them is so that white people feel relevant in sports. Because other than that the only thing the winter Olympics show me is which country has more rich white kids.

Usually this is between me and my maker, but I'll share it with you -- 28% of what I'm earning tonight, I am giving to the United States government.

We live in a culture where a prostitute on the street can earn more money than a school teacher. That's disgraceful. We have to start paying prostitutes as poorly as we do school teachers.
I've lived in New York for a long time, same apartment, and there are a lot of robberies in that building. And I felt so bad for my neighbor because her dog and VCR got stolen -- nothing else, just the dog and the VCR. I wonder what the burglar was thinking at the time? 'Hmmm, I'd really like to rent a movie, but I don't want to watch it by myself....'

There's a store in my neighborhood called Futon World. I love that name, Futon World. Makes me think of a magical place that becomes less comfortable over time.
I like to go to stores and mess with the salespeople, get them back. They mess with you all day. I go in the store, right? And I just try stuff on and walk around in it. They can't tell you how long to keep it on.

In L.A., rich people live with rich people and poor people live with poor people. In New York, that's from building to building. I asked my friend -- I said, 'Man, what's a good building?' He said, 'A good building, you've got a doorman. A bad building just got a man at the door. You don't want to mess with that.'
You go to the airport, they make you take off your shoes -- like black people are going to have a bomb in our g**damn shoes. As much money we pay for shoes, you must be out of your mind!

The only thing we've found since we've been [in Iraq] is $700 million. Remember that story? The two sergeants found $700 million in a cave. And I knew they was white boys soon as I heard they gave all that money back... If that was me, I would've reported it, but it would've been a different amount. I'm like, 'Yo yo yo, Captain! Yo, listen, we just found $48.92.'
If you ever go to Las Vegas, and you will, just go for a few days. I was there recently for seven days, seven days in Vegas. After I blew all my money on gambling and prostitution, I had six days to kill.

Somebody cut my bike seat. Think about that. What level of misery must you have experienced as a kid to see my 10-speed tied to a pole, pull out a blade and be like, 'Look at this rich mother f**ker right here.' You know, like I control the banks because I own a Huffy. I'm the bad guy; I'm the guy you want to get back at.
I like to dress up as a referee and walk into a Foot Locker. You gotta try this. It freaks them out. They get all insecure. The guy's like, 'Wait a second, can I help you?' I was like, 'Can I help you, man? I, too, am a referee. Maybe we could work it out together.' And then someone will ask me for a size 10, and I'll be like, 'Do I look like I work here, chief?'
===
I was like, 'Damn, do I look homeless?' But then I thought about it, and you know what? It could have been my first day of homelessness. You see, because on your first day of homelessness, you don't look that homeless. You don't stink yet, your hair's not matted down, you don't have the imaginary friend -- it's day one.
I didn't understand that. How could something get closer to zero forever? It didn't make sense to me until I got some credit card bills.

The post office advertises stamps on television -- stamps! We have commercials that actually go, 'Buy U.S. postage stamps.' Alright, now maybe it's just me, but my whole life, all I ever bought was U.S. postage stamps because when you try taping 37 pennies to the envelope, it never gets there.
My sister was the smart one. She took the dentures, stuck them under her pillow -- got a motorbike the next day.

I go into this store; the woman's like, 'Hi, I'm Suzie. Welcome to Shoe Casa, where your shoe problems are my shoe problems. What's your size?' And I was like, 'I have a size 10 wide.' She was like, 'Holy crap! Code blue, code blue! Sasquatch, aisle four!'
Don't get me wrong -- I'll put $25 on the ground and then if you pick it up and we have sex in an alley, that's not a crime. That's a coincidence.

I don't even have a clue as to where to find a pregnancy test. I'm looking at all the aisles -- they don't have one that says 'oops.'
Do you know what Bill Gates has to pull out of an old coat, to feel like I did with a $20 bill? First of all, the idea that Bill Gates has an old coat is preposterous. If he has an old coat, it's the coat Abe Lincoln was shot in and he wears it as a bathrobe -- no underwear by the way. He lets his billionaire balls swing willy-nilly beneath the death cloak of the great emancipator. That's your 1%.
===
I have 236 movies on my queue and I feel like I should always be watching movies. Like if I wake up in the middle of the night and don't fall directly back to sleep, I'm like, 'I've been up for an hour and a half I could have watched 'Toy Story 3' by now.' In this economy it is a sin not to be watching movies when you have Netflix.
I was at my parents' house all day -- because I live there.

Did you read about the couple that lost the $10 million in the McDonald's contest because their daughter was an employee? What a double whammy. They lose the $10 million, plus the embarrassment of having everybody know they've got a relative working at McDonald's.

They came to the airport naked. They're like, 'Can I get on the plane? I don't want to show you where my passport is.'
For as much as I know about being a guy, I ought to go to a hardware store wearing a tiara. 'Hi, do you have a bang-bang-bang to put the pointy thing in? I need a grab-hold and twisty because I'm putting up some -- help! -- curtains.'
===
Trickle-down economics -- it didn't work. The whole idea was supply-side economics: give rich people a lot of money; they'll spend it, it'll go into the economy. Here's what we found out -- rich people, really good at keeping all the money. That's how they got rich. If you want it in the economy, give it to the poor people. You know what they're really good at? Spending all their money.
This one homeless guy came up to me the other day, and he was asking me for money. I was about to give it to him, and then I thought, 'He's just gonna use it on drugs or alcohol.' And then I thought, 'That's what I'm gonna use it on. Who am I to judge the guy, really?'

I think anytime you use a roaming charge, a little icon should pop up with a guy getting f**ked in the ass. That way you know you're roaming.
You realize in this country it costs 70 cents a minute to sponsor a starving person, and it costs $2.99 a minute to talk dirty to somebody? One hour of phone sex will feed 259 starving people. If we could somehow get these starving people to just talk dirty to us.

I was out with this girl; I bought some drinks. We went back to my hotel room, she starts throwing up the drinks that I bought all over the hotel room; it was very upsetting. It was like she was throwing up my money on my money.
I went and bought one of these laser jet printers a while back: $99 bucks for a brand new laser jet printer. What a steal, I thought -- $99 bucks -- 'til a couple of weeks ago, the little ink cartridge ran out, and I had to buy a new one: $700.

My favorite was at the time of the Californian forest fires. I was watching the news and this guy genuinely said that apparently, in the blaze, 300 mobile homes have been destroyed. Now, I don't know whether there are that many advantages to a mobile home, if any, but one of the main ones, the big selling point of the mobile home is that you're not really tied down to an area. Especially if the said area is on f**king fire.

People always tell you: 'Don't give the homeless money because they're just going to spend it on booze or drugs.' I kind of feel like, 'Hey, the guy lives in a box -- maybe he could use a drink.'
I was a Theater Major in college. That's a sh**ty major. Theater Major is a stupid major. It is. I was on academic scholarship and then I used that money to become a Theater Major. That's like you win the lottery, and then you just spend it on Beanie Babies.

I went to Tower Records the other night to try to buy a new needle for my record player. I might as well have said, 'Excuse me, do you good men sell cannon balls? I'm fresh out o' cannon balls for ye old cannon back home. Come on, I ain't got all fortnight. The British are coming!'
They ask you dumb stuff on job interviews, like, 'What do you think you can bring to the company, Jesse?' 'I got a stapler. Other than that, I don't really have much. That's why I was looking for a job. I kind of thought you guys might have some kind of work-for-paycheck exchange program.'
===
How did we get to the point where we're paying for bottled water? That must have been some weird marketing meeting over in France. Some French guy's sitting there, like, 'How dumb do I think the Americans are? I bet you we could sell those idiots water.'

Congress is going to start paying their own parking tickets. What noble public servants. Imagine the commitment of these people, paying their own parking tickets. Hey fellas, you want to impress us? Pay our parking tickets.
You ever been to Southern California? It rains, and the houses fall down... And they don't understand why this happens. In California, they figure, 'Here's a cliff. Let's build a house right there!' And they don't understand why it fell. If you can look over the edge and go, 'Wow, it would suck if this fell,' it will.
===
They are not fussy about the coupon. They are not looking for expiration dates. It could be from Linens 'n Things, and they closed. You could write 'coupon' on the back of a Snickers wrapper, and they will swipe it. I could write 'coupon' on my ass and sliiiide.
I was at a convenience store. I went in, and there was a sign near the magazine rack that just said, 'No Reading.' I don't like to rock the boat, so I just grabbed a bunch of candy bars, and I went up to the guy who was working there, and I was like, 'Which one of these is a Snickers?'
===
I don't have any curtains in my apartment. I tried to buy curtains; I went to the store, I was like, 'I would like these curtains, please.' And they were like, '$40.' And I was like, 'Nope.' Found out right then just how low on my list of priorities curtains were. It turns out I'd rather get drunk once than ever have curtains for the rest of my life.
They recently changed it a couple of months ago. Now it's: 'More Saving, More Doing -- That's the Home Depot.' That doesn't even make sense. Who's falling for that? More saving would be no doing. 'Juston, your kitchen looks like crap.' 'Yeah, I saved $1200.'
===
I love growing up in the 'hood because that's the only place you gonna find an ATM that'll let you take five dollars out -- in change.
Ya know, Starbucks keeps popping up all over the place, and they don't have a slogan yet. So I thought of one for them. Let's see if you guys like it: 'It's really expensive, but the line is long.'
===
I had a chance to go to Tokyo a couple months ago... but all my friends were bugging me. They're like, 'What're you gonna buy? What're you gonna buy?' I don't know -- candy? It's all I can afford.
We're driving along, and my father would go, 'How could they be so wasteful, throwing away perfectly good lawn furniture?' 'Daddy, I don't think they're throwing it out. Their drinks are still on the table.'

I ask myself questions in those stores I don't ask myself anywhere else, like, 'Will I live long enough to use all those paper towels?'
I forget I have Canadian money, I look at it. It's all light blue and pink with the Queen on it, and I just laugh, and I say, 'You have lady money.'
===
I buy clothes at thrift stores. But the thing is, that's not the trashy part, the trashy part is I will try the stuff on while I'm there. And you can't get cheaper than that. I'm in there, I'm like, 'I mean, well, it's nice. I mean, I don't know if it's a $1.85 nice, but it does bring out my eyes.'
She was a prostitute and a temp. Like, that's how expensive New York City is -- turning tricks is not enough money, you have to know Word and Excel.
===
I've been spending a lot of time in casinos because, apparently, I have a gambling problem. But I have learned something important to pass on to you about how to deal with casinos when you're there. Go get $100 in quarters when you arrive. Then, go to your room, lock the door; go to the bathroom and lock the door. Then, take the quarters and flush them one by one by one. And the nice thing about that is so often the toilet will back up and you will feel like a winner.
He said the reason the economy was bad was because people like you and I weren't buying enough cars and houses. So, I sent him a letter. I said, 'Send me a check -- I'll buy anything.'

You look at where we live, and you know, we are giving them $18 billion to rebuild the Iraqi infrastructure. They're gonna get jobs. I was thinkin' maybe we should just bomb ourselves so we could upgrade our school system.

I don't know if you've ever had only five dollars in the bank, but guess what -- you can't get it out. You can't. You can visit your five dollars, you can call it on the phone, but you can't get it out.
My bank is the worst. They are screwing me. You know what they did to me? They're charging me money for not having enough money. Apparently, when you're broke, that costs money.
===
The worst thing is you can't really react. I'm on a rocket to the Bronx. I can't go, 'Oh my God, somebody help me! I don't belong on this train. That's not my area up there.' You can't do that... When you get there you gotta get out like, 'I'm home, yeah. Good to be back on Six-Trillionth Street.'
Let's be honest, this is a consumer based economy in America. That's all we manufacture here is need and appetite. We are the world's mouth. They make things in other countries, and they're like, 'Send it to America; they'll eat it.'

I saw a truck out here today. On the side of the door, it said, 'Driver has no cash.' I'm broke too. I don't plaster it all over the side of my car.
My father was a gambler and an alcoholic, but he was also very vain. So one day, he gave up his vices to save up enough money for a hair transplant. Two days after the transplant was complete, he got drunk and -- on a $20 bet -- shaved his head. So, I owe him $20 bucks.

A couple days ago, I was crossing this bridge, and there was this character standing there with a cup in his hand. He goes, 'Hey, can you help out my wife and family?' I said, 'Sure.' And I pushed him off the bridge.
No matter who's president, it costs us money whatever they like. [Reagan] likes jelly beans. Carter liked peanuts; the price of peanuts went up. When Kennedy was president, you couldn't get a hooker for under $75.

One time I was in a really small town and they didn't have hotels, so they put me up at a bed and breakfast -- which is the exact same thing as a hotel except in someone's house, like a family already lives there. I felt like an orphan that had a new family. I wanted to rebel immediately. 'What time do you want breakfast tomorrow?' 'I know how to live my life!'
A few years ago, I was moving a new bed into my apartment, and this woman who lived in the building opened the front door for me with her key. She said, 'I'm not worried because a rapist wouldn't have a bed like that.' That's how she started the conversation. Now, what I should have said was nothing. What I did say was 'You'd be surprised.'
===
I guess that's not a tradition here in New York. I guess when you think about it, we've got cash machines, too -- they're just called tourists.
If Jeffrey Dahmer lived in New York, New Yorkers would have been like, 'Hey, you think that apartment's available?'

You know what I installed? One man neighborhood watch. Some people will call it a peeping tom; I call it one man neighborhood watch.

We were at this liquor store in Long Beach at 1 a.m. buying pornography, cigarettes and vodka. And then Darren goes, 'Hey, you want to buy a lottery ticket?' 'No, Darren, I do not. We're buying pornography, cigarettes and vodka. Clearly, we are not on a winning streak.'
Is anyone like me? Is anyone so broke you didn't even realize the economy is in trouble?

White rich, y'all. / Like my oil tanker ruined the ocean, y'all. / Like I use stem cells as lotion, y'all. / I'm rich -- white rich. / I start wars as a hobby; my limo has a lobby. / My cousin paid to kill that Kennedy, Bobby. / I'm rich -- white rich. / I love being rich, I never wait my turn and if you don't do what I say I'll put my p***y on your sideburns.'
===
With Obama, the thing is I gave him money, that's what hurt. I believed in the dude so much that I donated to his campaign. Obama was basically the stripper that was like, 'No fellas, this one really likes me.'
You know what the worst part about having a landlord is? People think its the money. It's so not the money. The worst part about having a landlord is having to call the landlord, 'landlord.' It's a bit of an exaggerated title, isn't it? For a guy who rents out rooms to strangers for money?
===
I went shopping for jeans a couple days ago, and I get some Generation X moron who fell off his skateboard one too many times: 'Would you like to try on the easy fitting jeans?' 'No, bring me the most difficult pair of pants you have. I want to piss myself at happy hour tonight -- something with 13 leg holes and the zipper welded shut.'
The biggest scam I fell for was college. It got me. 'Cause I swear, in high school I was up $40; now I'm down $60,000. All my friends, 'Hey Nore, what was your major?' Bankruptcy, motherf**ker.
===
I have no money. I'm terrible with money. I always give money to people on the street. I passed by this homeless guy, and he was out there calling out to everyone, trying to get everyone to give him money. And he's doing this, he's going, 'Give money to the homeless. Give money to the homeless 'cause you don't know, one day it might be you.' And I was like, 'Oh my God.' And I was about to give him some change, and then I was like, 'Maybe I should hang on to this.'
It used to be a 24-hour Home Depot, and they stopped doing that. I used to work the night shift, and they realized that the only people that would come in at two are people that were on drugs who thought they could build things.
===
Here's how rich I am: I'll, like, go into a Banana Republic and buy shirts two at a time. That's right, I guess you should applaud for that. Here's the thing, people -- you're probably saying to me, 'But Paul, those shirts cost a lot of money.' Yes. Yes, they do. They cost a lot of money that I have. Maybe I'll be walking out, and I'll see they have windbreakers by the door, a rack of windbreakers. And I'll say, 'You know what -- throw a windbreaker in the bag.' And the saleswoman may say, 'But sir, don't you want to try it on?' Try it on, try it on, try it on -- why? Why? If it doesn't fit, I'll throw it away.
Have you ever been so broke you can't believe it? You know that feeling? You find yourself saying, 'H-h-hold on, hold on for a second -- I have zero money? I don't think that's even legal.'

I'm shopping at these bargain basement clothing stores. Can you do me a favor and sign a petition? I want to change the name of all these places to Crap That Was Ugly at Full Price and Is Still Ugly at Half Price.
They have security in these stores. There's a man standing at the door. Do you understand what that means? Somebody made a life decision out there that they're willing to risk going to jail to steal something from a bargain basement clothing store. 'Hey pal, what are you in for?' 'These sequined culottes.'
===
Who cares if North Korea has the bomb? Everybody's got the bomb now: India, Pakistan -- I have the bomb. I got it last week at L.L. Bean, in sandstone. I got the bomb, and I got a free backpack with the bomb. And the backpack comes with a free water bottle, so I can hydrate myself as I'm being melted by the nuclear fire ball.

The king of a small African nation had an elegant golden throne in his large grass hut. When an old friend came to visit from another nation, he was worried that the man would discover he was a king and treat him differently. He searched frantically for a place to hide the throne, but to no avail. Finally, he decided to have it wedged up in the ceiling of his hut.  When his friend arrived, he went to the hut's opening to greet him. Just then, the ceiling started to give way, and the golden throne fell on the king and killed him.  The moral of the story is this: People who live in grass houses should not stow thrones. 
Why did the perv go into Victoria's Secret?

One of my favorite things about New York is our slogan for the New York State Lottery. I'm sure you've seen it, on the subway or a billboard, which is just, 'New York State Lottery: Hey, you never know.' That's what they went with; they had a meeting.... No one else advertises that way. Just like, "Starbucks: Maybe it makes you immortal, I dunno."
I'm a grown ass man. If I lose a hat, I don't give a sh*t. I have money -- cash -- on me now. I lose one, I go buy two: throw one in the street, wear the other like a victory crown.

My nephew wanted me to get him some of those pump up basketball shoes, costs $150. I'm sorry, people, but I'm not gonna pay $150 for shoes that I gotta pump that don't pump back.
I love when I get a piece of mail, and above my name, it says, 'You've already been approved.' I am telling you, pre-approval -- is that not such sweet, sweet serendipity? For me, that's like the perfect hit. I get that natural high. I liken it to that feeling you get when you find an anonymous love letter or an unexpected Valentine's Day card. You know that feeling of 'I'm special! I'm wanted'? Much to my dismay, I am wanted -- by several collection agencies.
===
Today, I bought a pastrami sandwich: $13.75. Walked back out in the street -- genuine Rolex watch: six bucks.
I don't have a lot of sex, man. I really don't 'cause there are lot of obligations that come with sex... like paying people's rent. It's too expensive.

Eventually, I went to Hawaii. You ever been there before? It's beautiful. The travel agent told us, 'Stay off the beach a ways and save some cash.' Give you an idea of how far off the beach we were -- we were in Jersey. You know what? They're a little rude in that part of Hawaii.

I was driving down here tonight; I saw a guy talking on a car phone in a Yugo. I was thinking, 'Who's he talking to -- Kmart?'

Here's a tip for you when you find out they're a prostitute. Here's what I do -- I go, 'Oh my God, you're a prostitute? What a coincidence. I am also a prostitute. I'd be willing to waive my fee, if you would also waive yours.'
Car dealerships are the craziest. These people throw a party. Did you ever notice that? They get the streamers out. They got balloons up like they're conducting weather experiments or something. They got the search lights out there like Batman's gonna show up and apply for credit. They're giving away free hot dogs like it's no big deal. 'Yeah, I'll take a $25,000 automobile if you throw in a hot dog. You bet I will.'

Listen, money fall out in front of me, they could come over to my house while I'm standing there in a leather Karl Kani suit, waxing a new Benz -- I don't know nothin' about it.
I don't drink as much as I used to. I don't like those hangovers anymore. Wake up with a splitting headache; your memory comes back like a little radio in your head -- 'Good morning, fool. It's time for the news. You got drunk last night, and you hit on some of the ugliest humans on Earth. Fortunately, you were rejected by all of them. On the financial scene, you blew all your rent money trying to buy condoms from a Pepsi machine. And on the lighter side of the news, you threw up on your front door. But you were at the wrong house, so it turned out OK.'

An elderly woman entered a large furniture store and was greeted by a salesman. "Is there something in particular I can show you?" he asked."Yes, I want to buy a sexual sofa.""You mean a sectional sofa," he suggested."Sectional, schmectional. All I want is an occasional piece in the living room."

A woman walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the loan officer.  She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000.  The bank officer tells her that the bank will need some kind of security for such a loan, so the woman hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce that's parked on the street in front of the bank.Everything checks out, and the bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan.  An employee drives the Rolls Royce into the bank's underground garage and parks it there.Two weeks later, the woman returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41.  The loan officer approaches her and says:"We are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we're a little puzzled.  While you were away, we checked out your accounts and found that you were a multimillionaire.  What puzzles us is why would you bother to borrow $5,000?""Well, where else in Manhattan can I park my car for two weeks for fifteen bucks?"
I hate when women have roaches and act like they don't have roaches. You go to their house, they see a roach -- they act like they've never seen a roach in their own house. Roach comes out; she's like, 'Now I don't know whose roaches these is. But these are not my roaches.' I say, 'He's got two pieces of ID with your address. That's your roach. He grew up in this apartment. He on your MySpace holding your son.'

I'm tired of hearing about how America's a bully. America is not a bully. Bullies beat you up and take your money, and that is not what America does. America gives you money -- and then we beat you up. We're the mob. We just kinda wait for the check to clear, then we show up going, 'Hey, you got a real nice f**king country here. Be a shame if something happened to it.'
I'm gonna miss Clinton, I really am. I don't care that he had affairs. It doesn't bother me. He's not screwing my girlfriend. And even if he was, the economy's in great shape. I can't get another economy.

You take a glass, and you wrap it in paper, and you put it in the box. You take another glass; you wrap it in paper, you put it in the box, and you finish the box. You close it and you write, 'Glasses' on it. But after about two days, you just have an open box -- f**k it -- just put the pillow and the toothpaste and the Q-Tips, put the cat in there, and write, 'Crap I don't need. I hate my crap.'
I buy a bathing suit every year. Why? Because I can't get enough of the act of humiliation, ladies and gentleman. Generally, guys, do you buy bathing suits every year? No, of course not. You're guys. You cut off a pair of slacks, call it summer.
===
A lot of natural disasters, right? It's depressing -- gotta keep giving money, can't afford it. Gets to be like friends' weddings now -- like, 'Damn, another one. Tsunami plus guest. Ugh.' Hurricanes, earthquakes, mudslides -- it's like the drink menu at T.G.I. Friday's unleashing its wrath on the universe.
Rappers misspell things from time to time, just for fun. They'll use a 'Z' instead of an 'S,' a 'Y' instead of an 'I.' If I was an accountant, I would do that with numbers. I'd be like, 'Yo, here's your check. I used a 1 instead of a 5. Just keepin' it real. Don't wanna embezzle, my nezzle.'

The lottery.
That's like a filing cabinet for a poor person. I have that. I want to carry my money in a big stack like the f**king Grinch that stole everything.

I used to be a substitute teacher. That's a crazy job. They call you up at six o'clock in the morning. They wake you up. Then, they ask you if you'd like to come in to work, and you can say no. My first year of teaching, I made $72.14.
I had sex with a woman. I took out the box of condoms. She takes the box from my hand, looks at it, and goes, 'Hey Todd, good choice.' Now, I didn't expect her to be a virgin, but this is no time to show brand loyalty.

I just got a new apartment, people. You guys can all come stay. Twenty-three bedroom apartment, seriously. Every bedroom has a baby grand piano in it. Sitting next to the baby grand piano, I swear to God, a regular size grand piano. Architectural Digest did a story about the place. They called it the 'Pretentious Douchebag Palace.'
I can understand no wallets at Old Navy, but no ties? What am I supposed to wear with my mock-ribbed turtleneck and purple camouflage cargo pants? I've got a funeral to go to.

I spent $40,000 on my education. I own $40,000 worth of information. It's all contained in this small area right here. I've been out of college 17 years, and in 17 years, no one has asked me for any of this information. I could have stayed stupid and bought a Lamborghini.

You know what's pretty cool? When you put on a jacket that you haven't worn in a long time, and you find a $20 bill in the pocket that you didn't know was gonna be there; then, you buy yourself some weed to celebrate. That happened to me tonight when I borrowed my friend's jacket.
I'd've said, 'How much you want, Troy -- $12 million? You crazy? Wait a minute, let me look -- alright, I'm gonna give you $12 million, but when the game starts, all you're gonna have is a center and a wide receiver. You say you want some blocking? You got enough money; you better get some.
===
Your tax dollars pay cops' salaries. For black people, that should be optional. We should have to check a box on our W-2 form. 'Would you like to pay a cop?' 'Hell no, give me my money.' That's why black people run from the cops. You on the clock, I might as well get my money's worth.
I feel sorry for Michael. I have ever since I saw that Oprah Winfrey interview, where we found out he has that thing that causes black people to gradually lose their color -- what's it called? Money.
===
You ever feel like you get a little extra money, run into a few bonus bucks somewhere -- and then something happens right away to just suck it right out of your hands? Has it gotten to the point where you can't even take the anxiety of having extra money, and you just wonder what the hell's gonna happen? You play lottery? I won't play it. Uh-uh, too risky. If I won the lottery, $8 million worth of sh*t would happen to me.
Certain names you gotta do something with your life. Like Preston -- you can't be homeless and named Preston. I think the government set aside money for you.

Here we are starving ourselves to death for two groups of people that wouldn't want to screw us anyway.
Women still make 76 cents to every dollar a guy makes, and then we get told, 'Well, you chicks aren't good in math.' Well, you know why we're not good in math, Mr. Boss Man, Mr. Associate? It's because we know that things aren't equal.

A guy walks into a bar, orders 12 shots and starts drinking them as fast as he can.The bartender asks, "Dang, why are you drinking so fast?"The guy says, "You would be drinking fast, too, if you had what I had."The bartender asks, "What do you have?"The guy says, "75 cents."
My girlfriend called me because one of our other friends is getting married. So, they told me I had to pitch in for a male stripper. I said, 'You out your damn mind. I ain't payin' for no naked-ass man.' I mean, you think about it -- women? We really don't have to pay to see that. I mean, really -- we spend most of our time trying not to see that.
===
I'm gonna tell you right now -- somebody walked in here and told me I just won the lottery, I will walk out in the middle of this joke.
Of course he had a bad attitude -- 25 years old, $60 million. When I got my student loan, I was a d**khead for three weeks.
===
I read in Cosmopolitan Magazine that men and women find satin sheets in bed very sexy, which is exactly why I am not going to be buying them. Because that's what I need in my bed is another thing that will make me ejaculate more quickly -- no thank you. No thank you, I'll just stick with the Smurf sheets.
I don't mean to stereotype, but like most women, I love to shoplift.

Let me give you one word of advice: never go to a sex shop when you're horny. You have no idea what you're going to end up with -- make a list; stick to the list.
This mafia family was in need of a collection   officer, and after screening many applicants they   hired an individual who happened to be   hearing impaired.      He was very good at what he did, and within a week he   had collected $40,000. from non-payers, however he   was greedy and hid the money for himself.It didn't take long for the mafia bosses to catch   on, so they sent a couple of thugs and an   interpreter to find the collector. They found him,   took him to an abandoned warehouse and the two   thugs told the interpreter to ask the collector,   where's da money?   The interpreter signed to the collector and the   collecter signed back, I don't know what you're   talking about.The interpreter told them what he had said   and one of the thugs pulled out a 38 revolver and   stuck it in the collector's ear. He told the   interpreter to ask the collector about the money again.   The interpreter asked.The collector signed back, It's in a tree stump   in Central Park 50 yards east of the main   fountain!The interpreter tells the thugs, He said he still   doesn't know what your talking about and you don't   have the guts to pull that trigger!

Guys, have you ever woken up with an erection, and then you realize you're just in a massage chair in a Brookstone?
===
Didn't you like those old shows, like 'Tarzan'? Remember 'Tarzan'? Story about a white guy who grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood?
They said the darker you were, you know, you were further away from the slave house. I learned that! The light-skinned people, they say, there was some mixing going on. Man, my family was so dark, we were two feet from freedom! We didn't even know there was a house on the plantation.
===
There was a white running back that was five votes away from winning the Heisman and white people didn't even give a sh*t. He was your Jackie Robinson -- a white running back. That's like finding a white rhino or something, you ain't never seen that. And his name was Toby, how beautiful is that? If somebody had told you two years ago that the best running back in the country's going to be a white dude and the president was going to be black -- you'd be at work like, 'Yo, they drug test here.'
I'm half-Mexican -- get used to it 'cause in about five to 10 years, you're all gonna be related to one. Whether you like it or not, no matter how much you prepared your family, you're gonna show up at Thanksgiving one of these years, you're gonna walk in and say, 'Hey! What's happening? Since when did we start serving flan?' Well, what's happening is that somebody's boning a Latino.
===
Then I get there and I swear -- it's San Jose, CA -- there's 2,000 Mexicans. And you know you're half-Mexican when you walk in and you're like, 'Damn. This is a lot of Mexicans. Only half of me is the only white guy here.'
White folks is my favorite thing on TV 'cause if you wanna see blacks or Latinos on TV, all you gotta do is turn on 'COPS.' White folks got your own TV show, though; it's called 'When Animals Attack.'
===
Me and my cousin, riding the bus the other day, we're talking to these two black ladies in front of us. And before they got up, they asked me, 'Are you two brothers?' I said, 'Nope, we're Mexicans.'
Just like to start out, if I might, by mentioning up front that I'm German. I know there's a lot of baggage that goes along with my saying that. I know as soon as I say it, right away everyone's thinking, 'Oh my God, this guy is gonna be funny.' What if I'm not? What if I'm not as funny as some of the other German comics you've seen before?
===
You know what the worst part about my drinking is? When I'm drunk I slur. You know, like I say racial slurs. Wow, nobody likes that at a barbeque.
Over there, they smoke pot. They mix it with hash and tobacco, and they roll it together. The reason why they do that -- they have so many vices, they need to combine them.
===
Here's a guy who's never faced combat or anything in his life -- or really had a tough day -- and he's like, 'Bring it on,' I love that. He's like, 'Ya got a problem? Bring it on. Over there. In Iraq. Where the troops are.'
My dad was a complicated man. He was a huge racist, my dad, but he still tried to be a good father, you know? Like, he would tell me that Santa Claus was black -- that way, when I found out he didn't exist, it wouldn't be that big a let down.
===
She said, 'Where are you from?' And I said I was Irish. And she said to me, 'Oh you're Irish, are you? You'll be needing this.' And she left the drinks trolley down beside me.
I like to go to the frat house and drink with my white friends, because anytime you go drinking at the frat house, white boys bring you a drink and hand it to you like it's a top CIA secret. They'll hand me my drink, and I'll go, 'Man, what the hell is in this?' 'Dude, don't worry. Don't ask, just drink it. I'll see you in 20 minutes.' Next thing you know, I'm buck naked, standing on a coffee table, with a cowboy hat on.
===
There's no 'brothers' when it comes to white people. We are just complete individuals. We don't care about each other. He's not my brother; my brother lives in Ohio -- I don't know that guy.
If anybody here doesn't know how to dance salsa, let me help you out right now... One word: rum.
===
Of all the people there are least of, we are the biggest of that group.
How can you not love the Spanglish? I love it -- twice the vocabulary, half the grammar.
===
I just read Latino high school kids came in fifth on their SATs. Number one was Chinese -- OK. Number two was whites -- OK. Number three was blacks -- OK. Number four were 'others.' Damn! A whole race of people defeated by a pronoun.
There's prejudice in the NBA. The 3-point shot: designed to keep the white man in the game.
===
Such a politically correct time. I used to do a lot of racial material, but then people would think I was a racist and I'm not -- anymore.
My dad fought in World War II, and he never talks about it, of course -- 'cause he's Japanese.
===
I was doing some musical research, and I found out it was actually white people that came up with rap music. Only, they call it square dancing.
Don't orange alert me. We don't know what orange alert is. If you're going to alert me, make me do stuff. 'Lock your top lock' -- I'm all over that. 'Fill your tub with water' -- excellent. But don't mention duct tape to me, because that's weird. That tells me you don't know what's going on.
===
White people, you all just dance to the words, you don't even listen to the beat.
Race makes things funny. A black guy driving in NASCAR: not funny. A black guy driving a car sponsored by Tide: not funny. A black guy driving a car sponsored by Aunt Jemima: hilarious.
===
I was in Mexico, and I see how these people operate. They're not stupid. Did you know that in Cabo San Lucas, there is actually a Home Depot? I swear to God. Then I went inside the Home Depot, but there was nothing inside, completely empty. It was just a fa ade. And then I looked outside, and there were Mexicans standing out front -- but there was nothing inside, but they were outside. And then I realized: it's a training facility!
I was born in Honduras, that's where I was born. I live in California, where no matter what you say, you're Mexican. You understand that? It doesn't matter what you say. See -- you don't understand that, white people, because wherever you go, you're white. You're here, you're white. You go to L.A., you're white. You go to Denver, you're white. You go to Miami, you're still white. I'm Mexican in the Southwest, but when I go to Miami, I'm Cuban.
===
You know what they said in California? I saw it on C-Span -- people we vote for -- this is what they said, 'I propose that we kick all of the illegal aliens out of this country. Then we build a super-fence so they can't get back in.' And I went, 'Um, who's gonna build it?'
You couldn't be a racist and live in L.A. You'd be exhausted.
===
Cool sideburns, buddy, right off the bat. You too, man, don't mean to leave you out. I always notice that immediately, because I can't grow any... my mom says it's because I'm part Indian, and that the government took that from me too.
He a war hero that got captured. There's a lot of guys in jail that got captured. Sh*t, f**k that. I don't want to vote for nobody that got captured. I wanna vote for the motherf**ker that got away.
===
We're ready for a real black President -- someone like Jay-Z. Obama's fine, just not all black. He's our gateway Negro.
We might feel bad about it later -- ask Japan -- but before we feel bad, we're gonna jack you up. And then we're gonna send you food.
===
The day I'm in England performing, English security let a man in a Batman suit climb Buckingham Palace. I felt so much safer... Batman was on the wall of Buckingham Palace for five hours. Wouldn't happen in America -- three minutes: dead Batman.
I don't tell people I'm white anymore -- I'm albino-Cambodian.
===
Look at that! It's a park, and there's a white guy and a black guy and an Asian guy and a Latino guy. And that guy, he's Canadian -- don't worry about him, they never affect the world much at all.
We've got to have every g**damn nationality at that news desk. I am so sick of that sh*t I could scream. Give me four white guys, four black guys, all women -- I don't care -- but do I have to have a g**damn UN meeting every time I turn on the set?

Confucious say, ''Man who runs behind bus is going to get exhausted.''
I want to take one of those English as a Second Language courses -- just go in and blow everybody away on the first day.

Two immigrants arrive in the United States and are discussing the difference between the Old Country and the U.S. One of them says that he's heard that people in the U.S. eat dogs, and if they're going to fit in, they better eat dogs as well. So they head to the nearest hot dog stand and order two 'dogs.' The first guy unwraps his, looks at it, and nervously looks at his friend."What part did you get?"
There's a lot of Pakistani cab drivers. I wonder if you go to Pakistan, if all the cab drivers are American, and all the Pakistani guys mess with him? 'Look! His name is John -- only one syllable! Close the flap. You stink like cheeseburger. Now drive.'
===
In this era of political correctness, you really have to watch what you say. I had an incident here in New York City on the subway. This black gentleman approached me really enthusiastically, and he asked, 'Hey man, did the Yankees win?' And I said, 'Yeah -- you're free.'
The Japanese prime minister came out a couple months ago and said all Americans are lazy and overpaid. Yeah, is that a bad thing? That's why we live here.
===
It's nice to live in a country that has its priorities straight: the library's open three hours a week, and the House of Fist is 24/7.
I have no problem with illegal immigration in this country, except for the fact that they don't serve on jury duty. That's horse sh*t. It should be the other way around -- they should serve exclusively on jury duty. Then it finally would be a jury of one's own peers. It's not a stereotype if it's always true; then it becomes law.
===
I'm surprised he don't go, 'Alright, Kunta Kinte, Kanye, whatever your name is -- you're right, I don't care about black people. I barely like the six that voted for me, so I don't care what you say.'
I knew there were no weapons of mass destruction. Sh*t, I saw more in Charleton Heston's basement than I did when I was over there -- I don't give a damn.'
===
You know the only time racism is really good for black people? Terrorism. Terrorism -- never take black hostages. You know it's true. You know why they don't take black hostages, don't you? 'Cause we're bad bargaining chips. They call the White House, 'Hello! We have got five black people, and we will kill them, too! Hello? Hello?'
I took two white friends of mine to see the movie 'Malcolm X,' and they were just -- they were shocked. They weren't too shocked at the movie; I think they were more shocked 'cause they didn't know that black people like to talk at the movies.
===
I was just vacationing in Amsterdam, where prostitution is legal. Let me rephrase that -- I was just vacationing in Amsterdam because prostitution is legal.
An infamous killer is on death row, and he is allowed one last meal an hour before he dies.He asks if he can have his favorite food, which is Mexican, and the guards give him whatever he wants.An hour goes by, and it is time for him to go. One of the guard asks if he had any last words.The guy replies, "Yeah...pull my finger." 
===
A quick way to start a conversation is to say something like, 'What's your favorite color?' A quick way to end a conversation is to say something like, 'What's your favorite color person?'
I want a girl so dark, when I turn the lights off, I don't know where the hell she's at.
===
You know why black people are never shocked? Because to be shocked, you've got to believe things are different than you believe they are. Nothing shocks black people. Everybody was shocked that the New Jersey governor was gay -- except black people. We was like, 'Oh, I knew he was gay.'
You ever have the police follow you so long, you get suspicious of your damn self? 'Maybe I did kill them people. I'm a go ahead and turn myself in.'
===
NYU's like a Jurassic 5 concert: it's like there's supposed to be black people there, but they're not.
When he was coming up, people were like, 'We have a serious black candidate for president. This is crazy. We have a serious black candidate.' And then when he won, they were like, 'Our first multi-racial president.' And I was like, 'That's not fair.' I mean, let's set the record straight. If you went outside tonight after this show and Barack Obama was stealing your car, you wouldn't yell, 'Hey, someone stop that mixed guy!'
===
I just got back from another country. Just got back from the south Bronx. Dogs bark in Spanish over there.
I didn't know you could name a Puerto Rican 'Israel' 'cause I'm pretty sure you'll never meet a Jew named 'Puerto Rico.'
===
A good start.
I had one boss who used to say to me, 'I don't see color. I don't care if you're white, black or purple.' Purple? Really? You don't care if someone's purple? 'Cause that's gonna set off some alarm bells for me.
===
Slaves used to entertain the slave master, and he would laugh, but after the show, he wouldn't be any less racist. You know, he'd be like, 'Rastus, you were funny. I mean, you weren't give-you-your-freedom funny, but I enjoyed it.'
Talk to each other, that's how you do it. We talk to each other, and we ask each other questions. They might be awkward questions, but that's how you get the ball rolling. Like, you can say, 'Hey white man, how come you're so tense and afraid?' Then he can say, 'Hey black man, how'd you get into my apartment?'
===
What a lot of people don't know is that a lot of those songs was like codes and messages, you know? Like 'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot' was, like, 'Swing low, 'cause the Underground Railroad is coming.' There was probably some slaves who probably tried to write spirituals but just really wasn't that good at concealing the message. It'd be like, 'Hey, Rascals, I hear you been working on a spiritual. Won't you sing it for everybody?' 'Alright, master. Oh, tonight at 8:30/Gonna get some shovels and bash white folk in the head/What time?/8:30/Do what?/Gonna kill white folk.'
Everybody's into rap. White folks love rap, right? Rap, rock, blues... White folks love everything about black culture, except the blacks.
===
My friends from Brooklyn would call me at work, kind of militant. They'd want to talk about the man coming down on the brother man and the system. And I'm like, 'Hey, can I call you back later? I'm at the system.'
As long as you can still scare white people, you're not a sellout.
===
White people talking about how Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves. No he didn't; polyester did. They stopped wearing cotton; they had to let us go.
You know what you never see today: Chinese construction workers. You ever notice that? You never see Chinese construction workers because, after building the Great Wall of China and working on the railroads, they're like, 'Hell no! No more construction.'
===
What did the Egyptian man say to the Egyptian woman?
"Come behind the pyramid, and I'll make you a mummy."
===
What do you call four bullfighters in quicksand?
Quatro sinko.
===
I love NBA basketball. It's my favorite black show on television.
No, Freddy, we're all just people.' Really? I hope you get mugged. Then we'll see how sensitive you are. 'Who mugged you?' 'Oh, it was a person.' 'What'd he look like?' 'Just people, really.'
===
What do you call Vasoline in German?
Vienerschlide.
===
Farfrompoopin.
I'm actually from the Caribbean island St. Lucia, and the thing is, growing up there, it was like all black people, man. I spent most of my life thinking that a racist was just a very fast person.
===
'Uncle Sam wants you to speak English.' If that's really what uncle Sam wants, then why did he write it in English?
Be happy with your stereotype. Asians -- that's the stereotype I want. Being the smartest person in the world? You're the smartest, what are you complaining about? You know what I get? 'Waaasuuup?'
===
The X-Games -- I watch that; I'm not impressed. That's white dudes' desperation. They're running out of sports. They gotta find something that black dudes won't touch.
I was in the park last night, chasing this white guy. He got away from me. I didn't know cops could walk that fast with all that stuff on.
===
I was watching one of these old reruns of 'Gilligan's Island.' Seven white people stranded on an island for seven years, and ain't nobody doing the nasty -- for seven years. You put seven black people on an island for seven years -- in three years, you'll have a new nation.
The Japanese scientists just found a 25,000-year-old mammoth in the ice in Siberia, and they're about to clone it... You think the Japanese of all people would want nothing to do with prehistoric animals after what happened with Godzilla.
===
The only reason we're not in Iran now is because we're going alphabetically and George Bush can't spell.
People come to this country from all over the world to pursue their dreams of driving a taxi or selling hot dogs or working in a sweatshop.
===
I'm taking a course here in New York in Italian martial arts. It's a lot like karate, lots of kicks and stuff, except there are two guys holding your opponent down.
Did you ever say something and wish you could take it back? Something like, 'Yeah, I'm a Jew. What are you skinheads going to do about it?'
===
He's like, 'Hey, man, where are you from?' So I told him, 'I'm from Queens, New York.' And then he's like, 'No, I mean where are you really from?' Which, for those of you who don't know, that's code for, 'No, I mean, why aren't you white?'
The president was on TV, said there's an education problem here in America. Went on to say that 60% of all Americans cannot find Germany on a map of the world -- 60%. And I say to the president, I say, 'Hey, listen here, Mr. Carter, so what if 60% don't know where Germany is? What about the 85% that do know what Germany is?'
===
I was in New York last Christmas -- it's snowing; there's a guy in a t-shirt. I'm like, 'Dude, aren't you cold?' 'No, I'm from New York. I don't get cold.' Just 'cause you're from a cold place doesn't mean you're genetically predisposed to not feeling cold. You're not a penguin. I was like, 'In fact, sir, you're Puerto Rican, so if anything, you should be more cold.'
I learned this one growing up in Texas and, subsequently, living in Los Angeles: always use the 'usted' form when speaking to a Spanish official. Mexican border patrol cops don't like it when you call them 'amigo,' give them a hardy pat on the back, slip a $20 in their pocket. No bueno, it doesn't fly. By the way, those of you not laughing at that obviously took French in high school, and that was a gay choice.
===
A new bar
What's Irish and comes out in the spring?   Paddy O'Furniture!
===
If I was in charge, I would not have the Olympics in our country anymore. Don't let the whole world come here and see our stuff. It just pisses them off.
My plan for illegal immigration is very simple: burning river of gas. Yes -- with the whole border, burning river of gas. And I say we do Canada, too, just to be fair. We do not need Alan Thicke coming down here whenever he wants.
===
You ever see a white kid trying to hit on a black woman? 'Hey, baby. Hey, I know they say once you go black, you never go back. But you should try white, that sh*t don't bite.'
I think all you white people should be called 'white' -- follow me now -- and I think all people of color should be called 'wheat.' See, this will be perfect because I like the idea of me being nutritious. That's an n-word I can live with.
===
Doesn't the lottery have pretty unrealistic names for those tickets: Mass Millions, Fast Cash, The Winner's Circle? How about a more real name for a ticket, like Fat Chance or Lose Your Insulin Money? Play and Lose Today? 'Try our new game, Tax the Poor!'
I never have free time. You ever go to the cash machine, there's two people in line front of you -- you get kind of flustered? You're like 'Forget it! I'm not standing here for 40 seconds. I've got things to do.'
===
My neighbor is super nice, neighbor Carlos, came over and he said, 'I hope you don't mind living next to a Mexican, 'cause we leave s**t on our lawn.' I said, 'Well, if we're going to talk in stereotypes, I hope you don't mind living next to a white lady -- 'cause I'm gonna steal that s**t. Manifest Destiny, it's kind of already mine.'
What I don't understand is when people write letters to magazines to say how much they agreed with a particular review or how much they enjoyed a particular article, you know what I mean?... You might as well write a letter to your grocery store. 'Dear grocery store: thanks for putting your eggs in a carton. It makes them a lot easier to get them home.'
===
I wanna be there when one of these guys snaps, loses it, says the wrong thing at the wrong time -- their subconscious just takes over and he can't help himself: 'Well, that's your 17th win in a row, Tigger -- TIGER!
In the LA Times it said: 'This is the biggest presidency for African Americans ever.' I don't know, that Lincoln one was pretty big, right? That was a huge one.
===
This country would suck without black people. Football would be all slow.
At this point we should just make it the 51st state. Welcome to Iraqachusetts: live free and die.
===
I wish I was ethnic; I'm nothing. 'Cause if you're Hispanic and you get angry, people are like, 'He's got a Latin temper.' But if you're a white guy and you get angry, people are like, 'That guy's a jerk.'
I love my brothers, but I would not want to share a kidney, a spleen and a liver with them. Two Irish guys, one liver?
===
One day while I was in Italy, I visited some old Roman ruins, and for no reason I could figure out, these ruins had a maintenance department. How do you maintain a ruins? What, does a foreman come in at nine o'clock and go, 'Fellas, leave it the way it is. I'm going to take the rest of the day off.'
White people, don't be embarrassed, because we have a show that makes us feel the same way -- it's called the news.
===
White women -- when you get a big ass, white women get all crazy. 'Honey your ass is getting big.' 'What? No! Stop it! No!' You tell a Latina or black woman her ass is getting big, she goes, 'Oh really? It's good, right?'
I have never been so glad to be back in America, where people speak Spanish.
===
Irish people don't want comfort. Look at a sweater made in Ireland -- it's like a turtleneck made out of Brillo pads.
A blonde, German woman with spiky hair...walked up to the plane and said 'There are busses outside that you will be loaded on to. You will be told what will happen to you when you reach your destination.' And all I could think in my head, was, 'I am not getting on those fucking buses. No, no, I have seen too many Oscar-winning movies. I know how this story ends. I know what you do to people who look like me. If I'm getting on any bus, it's with the blond family over there.'
===
The fact that politicians don't swear is something I've always found inherently untrustworthy. Look at Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the UN. If he doesn't swear, considering what he hears about every single day, during his job... that is a real problem. If the first thing out of his mouth in the morning... when the phone starts to ring before he's even had the chance to sit down... is not 'What? What the f**k do you want? Can I not just drink my f**king coffee and eat my f**king bagel before you tell me what f**king calamity has just befallen mankind? I f**king hate this f**king job. If my wife... asks me one more time 'How was work today, darling,' I'm going to lose my s**t. How was work today? It was f**king harrowing, sweetheart. How is it being married to the shell of a man? F**k.' If that is not the first thing out of his face, he should be fired on the spot.
It's OK that I'm swearing. One, because, you know, I'm lucky enough to live in a country where I'm allowed to do that, and two, and much more importantly, I'm British, and it just sounds adorable coming out of my mouth. You know it's true. You just can't be offended in the same way. I'll give you an example: f**k knuckle. That's borderline poetry!
===
It's pure Americana. It couldn't be any more folksy or wholesome unless Huckleberry Finn suddenly walked in carrying a freshly baked apple pie and started dropping the n-word.
I'm really white. I'm English white, that's basically turbo white. My skin is borderline translucent. If I'm standing, and the sun is behind me, I'm a functioning x-ray.
===
I think the best analogy for where we are right now is that America is Elvis Presley -- the most beautiful, talented, rebellious nation in the history of Earth. And now, you're in your Vegas years. You've squeezed yourself into a white jumpsuit, you're wheezing your way through 'Love Me Tender' and you might be about to pass away bloated on the toilet. But you're still the King.
Frankly, I could not f**king believe I was not allowed to vote. Three and a half years I've lived here! I work hard -- relatively speaking for someone who does this for a living. I pay my taxes. I try to fit in. I've learnt your rudimentary language. I don't know what more you could reasonably expect me to do. And that's when it hit me. I know why I'm so angry. I know what this is -- taxation without representation. Now I get it. Now I see why you got so pissy about it all those years ago. It is annoying. You were right. It is annoying and consider that as close to an apology as you are ever going to get.
===
Even if you had an all-white high school with only one black guy in the entire school, you would still see 89 white kids in Fubu before you see one black guy with a mullet and a hockey jersey.
There are some things that black guys can do that [white guys] just can't. Like wear a purple suit and not look like The Joker.
===
Being the third generation, I feel all-American, you know? I feel like baseball and apple pie, but I realize I look like nachos and cockfighting.
Older black men... have a tendency to make up their own sayings that really don't make any sense at all, but they say it with so much commitment and conviction, they make you think twice about it. You ever notice that? 'Well, you obviously know what's going on. What's the secret of youth?' 'Why don't you tell me?' 'I'll tell you what it is. I'll tell you what it is right now -- gotta live your life like two feet with 10 toes and an extra toenail!'
===
My family actually had an intervention. They were like, 'Hey, listen, we're Irish Catholic. What's this quitting sh*t? You're breaking your father's heart. Your sister's getting married in two weeks. There's an open bar. Cut the sh*t.'
This woman comes over to the bartender. She didn't want to offend him, so she orders an African American Russian. What the hell is that?
===
White people will go anywhere. They don't care. It's like, 'C'mon, let's go! It'll be fun!' See, black people, we can't just roll out like that, man. We gotta ask questions before we go, like, 'Is there gonna be a lot of cops up there?'
I'm actually the only black person I know currently involved in an exchange program with Harlem, and I recently enrolled in EBSL: Ebonics as a Second Language. Next week I take finger snapping and neck rolling.
===
I'm from Plano, Texas. Has anyone ever heard of Plano at all? For those of you who haven't, Plano is a suburb north of Dallas that happens to have the ethnic diversity of a Klan rally.
The father of the bride was my cousin, Sal. Sal was in the construction business, and that's all we say.
===
Literally 10 seconds after I get out of my car, this car pulls up, this guy pokes his head out the window, yells at me, he's like, 'Hey Kumar, where's Harold?' and drives away. Ten f**king seconds! Like he's been waiting around the corner for weeks, like, 'I can't wait for a brown to come to town! I've got a pop culture reference that will belittle him!'
Most of the people who are racist to me are white, and it's very tricky to try and be racist to white people. What am I going to be, like, 'Oh, I'm Kumar? Well, you're the lead in most movies that come out.'

I've seen the end of the universe, and it happens to be in the United States and, oddly enough, it's in Houston, Texas. I know -- I was shocked, too. Imagine my surprise when I left a comedy club one day and walked to the end of the block, and there on one corner was a Starbucks, and across the street from that Starbucks, in the exact same building as that Starbucks, there was -- a Starbucks. I looked back and forth, thinking the sun was playing tricks with my eyes. That there was a Starbucks across from a Starbucks -- and that, my friends, is the end of the universe.
We're the greatest country on Earth except when it comes to getting sh*t done.

First, we have Colin Powell waving this vial of nutmeg around at the UN -- 'It's a weapon of mass destruction!' -- and then, there was the yellow cake uranium. So, now we have nutmeg and yellow. So, apparently, we need to get into Iraq because Saddam is this close to making sticky buns.
If you're not sure who is a terrorist in this country, they've really helped us out to figure it out. If you go to the website of the Department of Homeland Security, they'll give you some hints. First thing you want to look for is pregnant women, 'cause they're probably not pregnant, they're probably just terrorists in disguise. So I suggest, your duty as a citizen is to walk up to a pregnant woman, punch her right in the gut -- just to make sure there's not a bomb under her jumper. It's your duty, you're deputies.

I had this happen for the first time ever. I had a white girl come to my door and complain about my music being too loud. And I got pissed off. I was like, 'This is a black neighborhood.

Can I wrap the anthrax around myself and run into somebody?'

New York acts like it's a big melting pot, 'cause it's like all the different cultures, 'Oh, we all melt together.' And then you move here and you realize it's not a melting pot at all. It's actually a bunch of pots that want to live next to their own kinds of pots and not talk to other pots.

If you are not Indian and you see a movie about India, don't think, all of a sudden, you can relate to me like we have this magical connection. I get this, literally, once a week for the last three years: 'Oh my god, you're Indian? Have you seen "Slumdog Millionaire"?' And that's wrong, 'cause you wouldn't do it to anybody else. 'Oh my god, you're black? Have you seen "Big Momma's House"?' 'Oh my god, you're so damn ugly. Have you seen "Shrek"?' 'Oh my god, you only have one leg? Have you seen "Footloose'?'

As a black woman, I feel like it is my duty to impart some information on you, a veritable PSA, if you will.

These three men were stranded on an island: a Nefoundlander,  a Cape Bretoner and a Quebecian.   The three searched the island to try to find a way off when the Nefoundlander came upon a lamp with a genie.  The genie poped up and said, I will grant three wishes, so that's one for each of you.    So the Newfoundlander goes, Well I wish I was back in Newfoundland. So puff, he was sent to Newfoundland.

A guy calls into a radio station   and he says he has a joke for the DJ. The DJ   goes, Alright, let's hear it.  The guy goes, What has a 2 inch penis and hangs   down?  The DJ says, I dunno, what?  The guy says, A bat. What has a 12 inch penis   and hangs up?  The DJ replies, I dunno, what?  Next thing the DJ hears is a dial tone.  
I'm in London -- I'm in Piccadilly Circus -- and I feel this guy grab my knapsack. I turn around, and he's like, 'Oop! You caught me. I'm a pickpocket. Can I buy you a drink?' So, I had sex with him.

I'm not your typical black comedian. I don't do a lot of jokes about white people. I'd like to, but I was born in Denver, Colorado.
Helga hangs the wash out to dry, then goes downtown to pick up some dry cleaning."Gootness, iss hot," she says as the sun beats down on her. She passes by a tavern and says, "Vy nought?" So she sits at the bar."Bartender," she says. "I vill have unt cold beer, please."The bartender asks, "Anheuser Busch?""Vell, fine, tanks," she says, "Just ah leetle svetty."

All the British fans start singing to the German fans, 'If you won the war, stand up!' Right, I think this is the greatest thing I've ever heard at a sporting event because there's no snappy comeback for that, is there?
Another thing I do most black people don't do -- catch cabs. I love it. I can catch as many cabs as I want. They don't even know I'm black until I hop in the back and I'm like, 'To Compton!' 'But, that's all the way across country.' 'I know, and we're robbing stores on the way!'

A Native American walks into a bar with a cat, a bag of sh*t and a shotgun. He asks for a bottle of whiskey and immediately downs it. He throws the bag of sh*t up in the air, shoots it with his shotgun, and takes a big bite of the cat's ass.The bartender asks, "Buddy, what the hell are you doing?"The Native American responds, "I want to be like the white man: get drunk, shoot the sh*t and eat pussy."
I'm not politically correct. I still say 'black,' I do. Because 'African American' -- there's no bonus; it's not going to make your life any easier. You don't see black people standing around going, 'Woo yeah, African American. Man, I tell you, this beats the hell out of being black. We should have made the switch years ago.'

The only thing keeping him black is, every now and then, his father shows up: 'Hey, that's my boy, alright! Don't try to steal him now.'
As soon as he turned pro and he won his first tournament, I read, 'Bi-racial golfer wins first tournament.' Oh, OK -- 50/50: he's 50% black, 50% Asian. Alright, cool. Then after he won the masters, I'm flipping through Sports Illustrated, and I read, 'Tiger Woods is a quarter black,' and I'm like, 'Damn, he's down to 25% now, man. What the hell is going on? They're treating him like he's milk.'

A kilted Scotsman was walking down a country path after finishing off a large amount of whisky at a local pub. He felt quite sleepy and decided to nap against a tree.As he slept, two female tourists heard his loud snoring.  When they found him, one said, "I've always wondered what a Scotsman wears under his kilt."She boldly walked over to the sleeper, raised his kilt, and saw that he wore nothing at all.  Her friend said, "Well, the mystery is solved! Let's thank him for sharing!"She took off her pretty blue hair ribbon and gently tied it around the Scotsman's endowment.  A while later, the Scotsman was awakened by the call of nature. He raised his kilt and was bewildered at the sight of the neatly tied blue ribbon.   He stared for a minute, then said, "I don't know where y'been laddie... but it's nice ta see you won firrrst prrrize!"

A woman from another country wants to come to the United States.  So she goes to the visa department to get a visa.  When she gets the form, she fills out her name.  Her first name is ''Wanna'' and her last name, ''Fuckme.''  The visa guy reads over the application and  says, ''I'm sorry I can't accept this name.  It's inappropriate and you're going to have to change it.''  So, the woman leaves, and is gone for a month and when she returns, she fills out the same form again.  She writes her first name, ''Wanna,'' and her last name ''Fuckme-Please.'''

Absolutely nothing.
There was once a Scotsman and an Englishman who   lived next door to each other.  The Scotsman owned   a hen and each morning would look in his garden   and pick up one of his hen's eggs for breakfast.    One day he looked into his garden and saw that the   hen  had laid an egg in the Englishman's garden.   He was about to go next door when he saw the   Englishman pick up the egg. The Scotsman ran up to   the Englishman and told him that the egg belonged   to him because he owned the hen. The Englishman   disagreed because the egg was laid on his   property."In my family," the Scotsman said, "we normally solve disputes by   the following actions: I kick you in the balls and   time how long it takes you to get back up. Then   you kick me in the balls and time how long it   takes for me to get up. Whoever gets up quicker   wins the egg."   The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman   found his heaviest pair of boots  kicked the Englishman as hard as he could in the   balls. The Englishman fell to the floor clutching   his nuts and howled in agony for 30 minutes.    Eventually the Englishman stood up and said,   "Now it's my turn to kick you.""Keep the g**damn egg."

As usual, things were not going well at the United Nations. Thus, many visiting ambassadors had to room together. It just so happend that Vladimir, the Russian Ambassador, and Umballa, the Zambian Ambassador, were sharing a suite.     To pass the time, Vladimir introduced his fellow dignitary to the Russian game of roulette. He produced an antique Soviet revolver, and a single bullet. It took a while, but he was finally able to explain the gist of the game to Umballa.     Intrigued and excited, Umballa loved the game. By the time the U.N. meeting was over, the two had become fast friends. As they parted company at the airport, Umballa told Vladimir, ''One day, you must visit my country, and try our version of your roulette.''    A year later, Vladimir was in Zambia, and looked up his old friend. Umballa remembered him, and welcomed him with open arms.        ''I have come, my comrade, to try your game.''       ''Very well. Come with me.''       Umballa took his friend before six, buck-naked bush women. ''Pick one. Any one. And she will give you a blowjob.''    ''But my friend, where is the danger in this?''       Umballa replied with a toothy smile, ''One of them is a cannibal.''
I was on one of those websites where you upload your picture to the website and it uses face matching technology to find your closest celebrity match. My friend, who's a guy, got Angelina Jolie. I like this technology; he's a guy, he got a girl, I'm going to get a funny celebrity, too. My celebrity look-alike was Anne Frank...Anybody else think Anne Frank maybe shouldn't be on the list of celebs you can get on the site? It should be a light, fun game that you play while you're screwing around on the Internet at work. Not something that immediately references the Holocaust.

Nobody can ever learn our military's secrets -- unless, you know, they happen to have the Discovery Channel. Then, it's pretty easy, just tune in for a few minutes.
You know what I like about George Bush? He makes me feel like I could be president, too. No, he does. He's like the first guy, like, from my reading level, you know -- the first guy, like, from my math class to finally go out and do something!
===
Watch 'Headline News' for an hour. It's the most depressing thing you'll ever do: war, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, depression, recession, drought, flood, pit bull, war, famine, death, AIDS. Then you look out your window, and it's like, where's all this stuff happening? Ted Turner's making this stuff up, man. Jane Fonda won't sleep with him, he runs to a typewriter -- 'By 1995, we will all die of AIDS. Read that on the air. I don't get any, no one gets any.'
I know environmentalists exist, but whenever I see a guy on a bike, I don't think, 'Oh, sweet, there goes an environmentalist.' I'm always like, 'That poor sucker got a DUI.'
===
I'm a little upset with the athletes today. People holding out, baseball players using steroids -- what the hell is that? Using steroids, man, that ain't nothing like the old school. Remember the old school guys? These guys were men. Babe Ruth hit over 700 home runs after, like, banging hookers all night.
We had our family tree done. Turns out I'm a quarter gay on my father's side.

I'm from San Francisco, and we like to protest, you know? We protest cars; we protest world trade. Basically, we're the most progressive city in the world, except when it comes to one thing: progress.

I got to go to the Oval Office three times and hang out there... And it's weird. You're in the Oval Office, you think you're gonna be patriotic, but you're not. You just want to use the phone and call someone you know has caller ID.
Some of these politicians just make things up. Like, remember that guy Newt Gingrich? The guy just makes stuff up! Like, they asked him about women in the military, right? This is what he said: 'Women can't be in the military 'cause, of course, they've got that, uh, vagina. Uh, and they might be lying in a ditch at some point with a -- vagina -- and they might get an infection, and they'd all start crying, and everyone would go home.'
===
I'm going to miss Bill Clinton, but you know we'll still see him, you know we will. Because, remember, like, the losers in high school that would graduate and still drive around the campus at noon? That's going to be Bill Clinton at the White House.

Ireland's indigenous people were the Leprechauns...and they died out, tragically, owing to the fact that they were all male and that they never existed in the first place. Nothing will kill a race off quicker than never actually having existed.
I wish they would just call the news: What's Wrong. 'Hi, it's six o'clock, here's What's Wrong. Now for the local news, here's the worst sh*t that happened the closest to you.'

The United States used to know how to put on a war. You always used to get a little music with your war. You know, they had the dude on drums, dude on fife, you know what I mean? A little background music while you're getting shot.
That's like having to be Mike Hitler during the height of Nazi Germany. You're Mike Hitler. You work at a bakery. You're just trying to make ends meet. Meanwhile, your brother's out there just acting an ass. People come in the bakery and read your name tag and go off on you, you know? 'Hitler? You're the bastard that killed 6 million Jews and ravaged Europe and tried to achieve world domination by following military--' 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's my brother, dude. I just make strudel.'
===
There was one woman who had a giant sign and on it, it just said, 'America Is Better Than Abortion.' I think she meant that America was too good a place for the horror of abortion. But instead, it sounded like she had weighed both -- the American spirit and getting an abortion and decided that American spirit better. I think it is a bad idea to have grammatically ambiguous protest signs.
If this is airing in the future and no one knows who Karl Rove is, he's the reason you all live underground.

I love President Bush. I think it's great we have a president who always looks like he's looking directly into the sun.

You think they could stop putting these experts on the news with their doomsday scenarios of how the terrorists might attack us? Because you get the sense they're coming up with ideas that these people haven't thought of themselves.
Remember Osama bin Laden? Public enemy number one. We gotta get bin Laden. Then the new season of 'American Idol' came on, we're like, 'Ah, forget it. Whatever.'
===
You know who's a good role model? John Glenn: 77 years old, flew around in a space shuttle. That's impressive. He didn't actually fly the space shuttle; he's 77 years old, they just put him in it. That would have been a disaster. 'Discovery, this is NASA. Could you turn your blinker off, please?'
For those of you who didn't know, the theme of my set tonight will be colonialism -- which is why I will be speaking only in English.

Have you heard the word, friends? The al Qaedas are coming to get us. Every time you turn on the TV, there they are swinging on the monkey bars in their black bathrobes, somersaulting over that piece of wood. I'm afraid to go to the park in Home Depot.
What does it mean when the flag at the Post Office   is flying at half mast?Job opening!

Jewish people always try to out slavery black people. There's always like, 'You know, we were slaves first.' I'm like, 'That ain't no contest I'd like to win.' Who calls 'shotgun' on slavery?
I have a theory that Osama bin Laden is hiding in North Platte, Nebraska, and that we should bomb it just in case. If I am wrong, what have we lost?

Jeff Dunham: You're afraid of offending people?Achmed: Yeah.Jeff Dunham: You're a terrorist. You kill people.Achmed: That's different. Killing people is easy; being politically correct is a pain in the ass.

This co-worker of mine, who I don't know well at all, comes up to me and goes, 'Hey Jessi, I don't know if anyone's ever told you this before, but you look a lot like Anne Frank.' I didn't really know where to put that as a remark. But the worst thing is that my first thought was, 'Was Anne Frank hot?'
Marion Barry's a good friend of mine. I love him; he's a good pal. I was in Washington, D.C. about a year and a half ago, and Marion Barry meets me at the airport -- gives me the kilo to the city.

The only positive thing to happen in New York City after September 11th is on September 12th, every tourist that moved here -- from Maine and Wyoming and Minnesota -- got up on September 12th and stood in front of a video camera and said, 'It's not safe.' No kidding, it's New York City, it's not supposed to be safe. Get the f**k out. Real New Yorkers got up on September 12th and said, 'Hey, is there alternate side of the street parking today?'
My friends guilt trip me, 'You hear what Bush said today? You see his speech?' 'Uh, no.' 'How could you miss that?' 'I guess I got more channels than you do, dude. It wasn't on Nickelodeon. I don't care.' 'What about the education system and gay marriage?' 'I already graduated; I'm not gonna marry a dude, alright? I don't care.'
===
Here's how easy it was to get away with bank robbery back in the '30s -- as long as you weren't still there when the police arrived, you had a 99% chance of getting away with it.
On 'Cold Case Files' they solve old murders and it's really interesting. What I learned from it is that it was really easy to get away with murder before they knew about DNA... What was a murder investigation like in 1935? One cop would just walk in and be like, 'Detective, we found a pool of the killer's blood in that hallway.' He would just be like, 'Hmmm, gross. Mop it up. Now then, back to my hunch. Look for clues. I'll tell you what we'll do; we'll draw chalk around where the body is, that way we'll know where it was.'
===
Democracy is like a tambourine: not everyone can be trusted with it.
I'm a Democrat from Texas, which is pretty damn rare. There's more gay Sasquatch than there are Democrats in Texas. We don't get a lot of coverage. We're actually kind of like the team that plays against the Globetrotters.

George looks like -- he's like the crazy uncle that you got when you had problems in the neighborhood. 'George, I just got jumped down 16th street.' 'Come on, we'll go smoke 'em out!'
We had to practice what to do in case the Communists dropped the bomb on us. Like that would be the first place they'd bomb -- a Catholic grade school.
===
Here's my only thing with 'Harry Potter...' They go to this school, and they take classes like Defense Against the Dark Arts and Potions and Divination, but they should be taking math also, right? Why are there no math teachers at Hogwarts? Or history, or geography? They're getting tested on Care of Magical Creatures -- never heard of the Holocaust.
Why would they know the end of the world? They didn't have any pants. Did you know that? They didn't have the invention of pants. You think you can crack the secrets of the universe but not the secret of pockets? They just made a lot of calendars and they never said it's the end of the world -- goofy white people made that up.
===
Historically, castles are notoriously difficult to penetrate; there are moats, there are drawbridges, there's hot oil, maybe a dragon. Not in Medieval Times, they want you to come into that castle. Take advantage of that opportunity. They got their own exit off the highway; go see a historical monument when you can.
You don't even know what you're voting for half the time. I mean, you know who you're voting for, who can afford TV commercials, the grown men and women who want to run the country. And they spend billions of dollars to get a commercial that says, 'That guy's a jerk. Don't pick him.' And then the other guy's like, 'That guy's a dick. Don't pick him.' And you're like, 'Well, I'd rather have a jerk than a dick. That's a good argument.'
===
We don't have seasons anymore. You know why? We lost the ozone layer. Well, put it on milk cartons -- let's find it!
We don't have solar energy because the sun goes away each day -- and doesn't tell you where it's going.
===
As soon as he misspelled that word, if the Secret Service had any brains, they would have rushed him, thrown him to the ground and said, 'The vice president's been shot.'
The Republicans are smart: Reagan, he forgets everything; Bush, he can't remember. So you know Quayle's going to end up in office because he doesn't know anything to forget or remember.
===
Don't you want to know why they call me "The Rail Splitter?"
You know, they also used to call me "The Great De-pants-inator."
===
At a news conference, a journalist said to the politician running for the presidency, "Your secretary said publicly that you have a small penis. Would you please comment on this.""The truth is," replied the politician, "that she has a big mouth."
At least Bush has his priorities straight. It's not putting more poison into the water that's ruining the environment -- it's those homo-extremists that want to get married and have health insurance. Somebody stop them!
===
We promise my cousin Skillet a woman and some weed -- he'll gang bang all the way to Afghanistan and get that man for us.
When you think about it, he is a very smart man. He puts smart people around him. That's what you do when you have a deficiency -- put smart people around you.
===
They have suicide bombers. These are people who not only blow themselves up, they blow everybody else up. How do you get somebody to do this -- kill everybody and themselves? I can't get three people to help me move.
I don't care what anybody says, I think that George Bush is absolutely the right president to oversea the end of the world.
===
You're old enough to vote, but you're not old enough to drink? Look at who we have to vote for -- you need a drink. On election day, Bush calls for Busch beer and Quayle calls for a quaalude.
We had our Year of the Woman. It took us hundreds of years to get one Year of the Woman, then we get a year -- one of us cuts her husband's penis off. I don't think we're getting another year.
===
You got to look at the presidency like a car. Every four years they pass this car down to somebody. And Bush had this car for eight years. And for eight years he didn't do sh*t to this car. He didn't rotate the tires, he didn't change the oil. I don't even think this country was registered. He just drove it into the ground and threw the keys at Obama and was like, 'Good luck.'
What's the difference between mechanical engineers and civil engineers?

For those eight years Clinton was the president, it was like we had that really cool substitute teacher.
I was watching The History Channel, or as my grandfather calls it, The Hitler Channel. Don't know if you remember that guy -- big in the 40s?
===
People get very personally offended by talking about Bush at all. I was in Washington, D.C., and this woman came up to me and she goes, 'Um -- you know, he could be here.' And I said, 'First of all -- no. He's probably on vacation.'
I take one issue with him, which is that he always says that if you don't support the war, you don't support the troops. I just think that's a little manipulative because I love the troops. Because if they weren't the troops, I would be the troops, and I would be the worst troops. I'd be like, 'You expect me to carry a gun this heavy and run away screaming? That is too many things.'
===
I feel like whether you like him or not, Bush seems like a fun guy. Like he's that guy you invite to the bar-b-que 'cause you know he'll start the whiffle ball game.
I stayed at a hotel last week in Washington, D.C. It was the Abraham Lincoln Suites, and they have these Abraham Lincoln quotes everywhere. And one of them was like, 'Whatever you are, be a good one.' I just don't feel like he should get credit for generalities like that. Like, 'How Are Ya?' -- Abraham Lincoln.
===
We tell too much of our business. I don't understand war. Why we tell everything we're about to do? We're running around, trying to find out military intelligence on them. They don't need that -- all they do is watch the news, they see everything they need to see. They plan their strategy with the TV on and their maps out.
War is a silly thing. How you gonna bomb people, then give them humanitarian aid? That's the dumbest thing in the world. How you gonna send a plane with bombs and then one with sandwiches right behind it?
===
If you see a terrorist on a train about to blow themselves up, you have to go up to them and say, 'Hey! Stop it.'
I was reading this article that said you have to be more diligent, keep an eye out for suspicious people. Yeah, that might work in Minnesota, but I live in New York. What's suspicious in New York? Have you ever seen anything suspicious in New York? Have you ever been walking down the street in New York and seen something and went, 'That was weird.' Never... I saw a dude on a subway platform arguing with a hot dog. Is that suspicious?
===
I like science fiction, and I always wonder what it was like before science was so advanced. Back in ancient Greek times, what was sci-fi like? Was it like, 'Beware the pulley and the lever and the inclined plane: they're gaining awareness. It's "Terminator: Part 0 - Rise of the Simple Machines"'?
The person I want checking IDs at the airport are bouncers 'cause they're the only ones who can spot a fake. So, if a terrorist rolled up, he'd be like, 'Uh, here you go.' Bouncer be like, 'Says you're born in June. What's your sign, bro?' 'Uh, uh, I don't know, like, a Libra?' 'It's a Gemini! Get the hell out of here, dude! And too many dudes -- you brought too many dudes with you.'
===
As I'm standing there, I see they have a little sign with pictures of things you are not allowed to bring on the plane anymore. And they have, like, little drawings: circle, line through it, 'No!' One of the things you can't bring on the plane anymore is a bomb -- no, no, they had a picture, can't do it. And it was the classic cartoon bomb, like the bowling ball with the little sparky whip coming out of it. And then you might think, 'Oh, I got a way around that.' Uh-uh, not so fast -- they also had a picture of the bundle of dynamite with the clock.
Why can't we find Bin Laden? We're the most sophisticated -- let me back up -- he's six' eight''. He's six' eight''! Can't somebody just stand on a stool and go, 'Oh yeah. There he is. I see him. He's right there -- the guy with the eight-foot turban, the 12-foot beard and the video crew.'

The problem with political jokes is that they get elected.
How are politicians like diapers?You have to change them both often, and for the same reason.

What's the difference between a politician and a screwdriver?
A screwdriver turns in screws; politicians screw interns.
===
Which part of the military do babies join?
The infantry.
===
How many racists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
None. They don't want to be enlightened.
===
How many Republicans does it take to change a light bulb?Three. One to change the bulb, one to call the media and publicize it, and one to blame the electric bill on the Democrats.
I can't do journalism anymore because, as it turns out, there are two things that will get you locked up in journalism. One is malice; the other is reckless disregard for the truth -- these are my hobbies.

We were all thinking the same thing on 9/11, right? 'Those g**damn Wright brothers, I knew this was going to happen!'
I'm into the positives and negatives of words, you know what I mean? Like I'll say this: the United States Constitution, I think, is negative. It's right there: con-stitution, 'con.' You know what's positive? Prostitution. Let's get into that, everybody.
===
What's the difference between Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky.
Close, but no cigar.
===
How can you hate them? They spend most of their time blowing themselves up. I hate to admit this, but they're pretty much the Wile E. Coyote of terrorist organizations.
A member of the United States Senate, known for his hot temper and acid tongue, exploded one day in mid-session and began to shout, "Half of this Senate is made up of cowards and corrupt politicians!"All the other Senators demanded that the angry member withdraw his statement, or be removed from the remainder of the session.After a long pause, the angry member acquiesced.

Some of the finest quotes from the Honorable Marion Barry:"The contagious people of Washington have stood firm against diversity during this long period of increment weather.""I promise you a police car on every sidewalk.""If you take out the killings, Washington actually has a very very low crime rate.""First, it was not a strip bar, it was an erotic club. And second, what can I say? I'm a night owl.""Bitch set me up.""I am clearly more popular than Reagan. I am in my third term. Where's Reagan? Gone after two!  Defeated by George Bush and Michael Dukakis no less.""The laws in this city are clearly racist. All laws are racist. The law of gravity is racist.""I am making this trip to Africa because Washington is an international city, just like Tokyo, Nigeria, or Israel. As mayor, I am an international symbol.  Can you deny that to Africa?""People have criticized me because my security detail is larger than the president's. But you must ask yourself: are there more people who want to kill me than who want to kill the president? I can assure you there are.""The brave men who died in Vietnam, more than 100% of which were black, were the ultimate sacrifice.""I read a funny story about how the Republicans freed the slaves. The Republicans are the ones who created slavery by law in the 1600's. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and he was not a Republican.""What right does Congress have to go around making laws just because they deem it necessary?""People blame me because these water mains break, but I ask you, if the water mains didn't break, would it be my responsibility to fix them then? WOULD IT!?!""I am a great mayor; I am an upstanding Christian man; I am an intelligent man; I am a deeply educated man; I am a humble man."

Some time ago President Clinton was hosting a state dinner when, at the last minute, his regular cook took ill and they had to get a replacement on short notice. The fellow arrived and turned out to be a very grubby looking man named Jon. The President voiced his concerns to his managers but was told that this was the best they could do at such short notice.Just before the meal, the President noticed the cook sticking his fingers in the soup to taste it and again he complained to the chief of staff about the cook, but he was told that this man was supposed to be a very good chef. The meal went okay, but the President was sure that the soup tasted a little off and by the time dessert came, he was starting to have stomach cramps and nausea. It was getting worse and worse 'til finally he had to excuse himself from the state dinner to look for the bathroom.Passing through the kitchen, he caught sight of the cook, Jon, scratching his rear end and this made him feel even worse. By now he was desperately ill with violent cramps and was so disorientated that he couldn't remember which door led to the bathroom. He was on the verge of passing out from the pain when he finally found a door that opened and as he undid his trousers and ran in, he realized to his horror that he had stumbled into Monica Lewinsky's office with his trousers around his knees. As he was just about to pass out, she bent over him and heard her president whisper in a barely audible voice, sack my cook. And that is how the whole misunderstanding occurred.
George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, and Bill Clinton were on the yellow brick road, going to see the Wizard of Oz. When they got there, the Wizard of Oz said they could each have one wish.  ''I want to have brains,'' said George W. POOF! He got some brains.''I want to have a heart,'' said Dick Cheney. POOF! He had a heart (albeit a problematic one.)''I want to have courage,'' said Colin Powell. POOF! He had courage.Finally it was former President, Bill Clinton's turn. ''Well, what do you want?'' asked the Wizard.   Clinton thought a moment and asked,  ''Ummm... Is Dorothy around?''

There were some things I liked about 'Titanic.' I loved the characters of the band. I wanted the whole movie to be about them. They went out of this life and out of this plane of existence, and they shuffled off this mortal coil, doing what they loved to do... That's a really cool bit -- where they're going down, and one guy looks at the other musician, he goes, 'You know, I don't think they're listening.' And the other goes, 'Ah, they didn't listen at dinner, either.' And the other guy goes, 'Yeah.' And they just keep playing. I started to tear up at that moment. This girl behind me destroys the beautiful moment by saying this right in my ear: 'Ah, duh, maybe nobody's listening because the ship is sinking! Duh! Real good time for a concert! Duh!'

Mr. Bush Sr., my father, is really my brother.5) And my wife is really my mother.4) My fellow Americans, I am a clone!!!!3) My fellow Americans, I have to tell you all something that happened back in November. I rigged the votes. It's been on my small hillbilly mind all this time. Gore really won, but don't tell him (the loser).

Of course, if I could tell them my side of the story, I would tell them that drugs are very refreshing. I was an addict when I was younger, and it attracts the ladies. I'm not just talking ladies either. I was popular after I smoked. I was cool. It was the one time in my life when I felt accepted.... oh... what? We're still on the air? Oh?

Two aliens land on the earth, near L.A. They get out of their aircraft, take their scanners, and   start exploring their surroundings. After walking for a while, they suddenly see a L.A.P.D. cop   lying in the middle of the road.So the first alien says, "UX251, do you see the object on the ground?""Yes," answers the other, "what could it be?""I don't know, UX251, pass the scanner and see if we can retrieve some data on it."So they scan the object. "No data available, UZ11, what will we do now?"The alien thinks for a while, picks up the cap, and puts it on his head. "What could this object possibly be?" asks the other one.   "I don't know you weirdo," says the alien, "but I sure feel like beating the crap out of you."

You sell them and retire on the income.Enron Capitalism: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt-equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred through an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The Enron annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

The president is on national TV apologizing for getting oral sex. Why didn't he just stick with his lie? You got to stick with your lie. If you lie, you have to believe that lie whole-heartedly.

A man walks up to the whitehouse and shouts to the guard, "I'd like to speak to Bill Clinton, the President."The guard replies, "Bill Clinton is no longer the President of the United States.

About ten years ago, George Bush was visiting Mikhail Gorbachev at the Kremlin. When he got him alone for a moment, he said to Gorbachev, ''Mikhail, can you help me with a problem? I have some doubts about one of the key people under me. How do you decide that someone is smart enough to work for you?''''Well, when I was interviewing Eduard Shevardnadze, I asked him, 'Eduard, who is the son of your father but not your brother?'''''What did he say?'' Bush asked.''He said, 'that's me,' so I hired him.''Bush patted Gorbachev on the shoulder. ''Thanks, Mikhail. That's a great idea.''    As soon as he got back to Washington, Bush called Dan Quayle over to the White House.''Dan,'' he said, ''I've got a question for you. Who is the son of your father but not your brother?''Quayle looked rather puzzled. ''Can I get back to you on that in 24 hours, Mr. President?''  He was very troubled by this question. He kept thinking about it and thinking about it, but couldn't get anywhere. Finally, the thought struck him, ''I'll ask Jim Baker. He's a smart guy.''  Quayle called Baker on the phone.''Jim, I've got a question for you. Who is the son of your father, but not your brother?''''That would be me,'' Baker replied. Quayle broke into a big smile.''Thanks, Jim. You've helped me out big time.'' He went running to the West Wing and burst into the Oval Office.    ''Mr. President, I have the answer!''''Okay, Dan. Who is the son of your father, but not your brother?''''It's Jim Baker!'' said Quayle.''No,'' said Bush. ''It's Shevardnadze.''

After bad things happen, you need a cigarette, right? Like, let's say, I don't know, you kill a guy with a hammer -- you need a cigarette because sex and murder are the same. Because you say the same thing after both, don't you? 'Damn, I gotta get the hell out of here. What was I thinking?'

Do you know that in a few years I'm going to have to pretend I'm getting high in order to enjoy a Camel Light? I'm going to have to take the filter off, twist the ends up -- 'For the next hour and a half, act like my I.Q.'s dropped 80 points.'
I've been living in New York City now for four years. To this day, every time a crime in New York makes news at home, my dad calls. He called me last week: 'This old woman was beaten and mugged. Are you OK?'
===
California votes against legalizing pot. Great -- now no one will smoke it.
We often try to legislate morality. Like, you can't smoke a joint, but you can get drunk as hell.
===
My career's going pretty good. I just finished a screenplay. It's a cop buddy picture -- two cops: one cop has narcolepsy, the other one has Tourette's Syndrome. It's called 'Snoozy and Spaz.'
A real cop fights real crime. A vice cop's only job is to ruin the party.
===
I think the best way to stop a streaker is when the guy starts to streak, get all the security guards around, block all the exits and just let him run it out until shame sets in.
Cops on horses? What's going on? Is there a lot of illegal jousting going on in the city?
===
They can make a lot of money off of sending people to jail these days because it's like prison-for-work camps and things like that. And did anybody know that three of the biggest shoe companies have invested in the prison system now? So you know what comes next? Prison commercials. Can you see some of the brothers in there doing a shoe commercial? Live from jail? 'If I'd a had these on, dog, I'd a got away.'
You ever been so drunk, you got pulled over by a cop, and before he could get out of his car, you just got out of your car and went and sat in the back of his car? 'Oh my God! How did you know? I'm so glad you came to get me. Sir, I was about to kill a whole bunch of people, I promise you.'
===
I was out in L.A. during the last riots. I didn't get anything, but I was out there.
They make that announcement, 'If you notice anything unusual, please immediately report it to airport security.' So, I grab the guy, I go, 'Yeah, I just saw somebody pay $11 for a cup of coffee at Starbucks. And right around the corner, they're selling luggage inside the airport. I'm going to do another lap. I'll let you know if I see anything.'
===
You know where they do send your taxes? They give it to prisons, so prisoners can have weights to lift. You believe that? We've got muggers and murderers, and they're getting stronger. So when they get parole, they can mug your ass better than they did before they went in.
You work security and you ain't got no gun -- you're just a paid witness.
===
Somebody stole the tape deck out of my hunk of junk car. Somebody broke the passenger side window and stole the tape deck out of my vehicle. Here's what I'd like to say to the Crips and/or Bloods who dared to dream. They broke the passenger side window to steal my $100 Best Buy tape deck. Who locks an '89 Mazda? Check the door, dumbass. Take what you'd like.
I think if you go to jail for something you didn't do, you should get credit towards another crime.
===
Walter: My wife and I couldn't find any place to park anywhere near this stinkin' joint. And some jerk pulled up in a brand new Mercedes and pulled right into the handicap spot. He got out of the car and there was nothin' wrong with him, don't you hate that? So I ran his ass over. I made an honest man out of him! And his mother got out of the other side and started swinging her crutches at me -- took her out with the door.Jeff Dunham: Don't you feel kinda bad?Walter: Ah hell, they can carpool.
Walter: I ain't afraid of the cops around Santa Ana. You seen some of these guys? What, cops on bicycles? How intimidating is this: 'Alright buddy, pull it over. Ching-ching-ching'? What do they do when they arrest somebody? 'Alright, get in the basket'.
===
Did you ever end a relationship because if you don't, the police and court system will?
I'm in New York a couple of weeks ago, true story -- guy trying to steal my tires got run over by the guy trying to steal my car.
===
You don't kill people when you get fired. You steal stuff.
You've got to be careful. That New Yorker attitude will get you in trouble. I get on the highway -- first thing, I get pulled over for speeding. The cop walks over to me; I roll down the window. He says, 'Do you know how fast you were going?' I couldn't resist. I said, 'Yeah, I know exactly how fast I was going. What I didn't know is that you were parked behind the bridge. I think if I had known that, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation. Is there anything else I can help you with officer? I don't know if you noticed, but I'm in a bit of a hurry.'
===
I got pulled over for drunk driving the other day. The cops had me walk that line. I said the one thing you shouldn't say. I was like, 'Stop wiggling it.' 'Cause that gives you away.
I hate that show 'COPS.' You ever see that show? The thing about it is you can turn it on one day and see somebody who you know being arrested. That's embarrassing, man. Last week I seen somebody who I know, and I found myself cheering for him, man. I'm like, 'Run, George! Run!'
===
They got the best car thieves in the world in Detroit. Yeah, I didn't think they could take mine 'cause the windows were rolled up, the doors were locked -- I was in the car at the time, actually.
A police officer pulls over a driver and informs him that he has just won $5,000 in a safety competition, all because he is wearing his seat belt."What are you going to do with the prize money?" the officer asks.The man responds, "I guess I'll go to driving school and get my license."His wife says, "Officer, don't listen to him. He's a smart aleck when he's drunk."The guy in the back seat pops up out from under the blanket and says, "I knew we wouldn't get far in this stolen car."Just then a knock comes from the trunk and a voice calls out, "Are we over the border yet?"
===
They are not testing comics for drugs. If our job is dependent on that, there would be three working comics in the country, and two of them would have puppets.
The neighborhoods here are really nice, and then really bad, within a house of each other. Have you noticed that? I'm always afraid my car is going to break down, and Danny Glover is not going to be there.
===
Why do we talk like that to the police? Why do we come up with words we've never used? Suddenly we are Harvard graduates when we talk to the police. We super-educated: 'How you doin', officer? The reason I was exceeding the speed limit was due to the fact that I was trying to get down to the youth center so I could read and educate the kids on the extraordinary processes of the educational system of America. I know it's 3 a.m. I was trying to get a jump on the education so I could systematically control my universal. We can control their universe, so we could destroy the negative images of stereotypes brought to us by different elements or different factors in this universe.'
Mike retired Larry Holmes. And Larry didn't think about coming out of retirement until Mike was safely behind bars.

Roxanne Pulitzer: sex scandal, Florida. William Kennedy Smith: sex scandal, Florida. Pee-Wee Herman: sex scandal, Florida. Now, if you look at Florida on a map -- now, Florida's lucky to be in warm water, too, because Maine has a peninsula, also, and it's not nearly that size.
Having a gun, let's face it guys, is a lot like having a penis, I think. You got to keep it concealed. And if you wave it in a woman's face, chances are she'll call the cops.

My Ass Rides In Navy Equipment.
I love being in New York; every time I stay here I stay in a different area. Right now I'm in Chinatown which I like to call 'The Illegal Purse District.'
===
Knock on the door.
I ended up having to go to AA, which is ridiculous. First thing they tell you to do is stop hanging around with other alcoholics. Well, so I stopped going to AA.
===
My favorite show is 'COPS.' You watch that show? That's my show, right there. I can watch people get arrested in the comfort of my own home.
My favorite is that 'Criminal Intent' with Vincent D'Onofrio. That guy knows everything. He could look at a footprint and go, 'She liked her eggs over medium.'
===
If you get a ticket, you can go to traffic school, and they make you watch movies for like eight hours: head-on collisions, mannequins flying out the windshield. At the end of the movie, the instructor goes, 'Now what have we learned by this?' Never let a mannequin drive your car.
They got too many rules on the job. I used to work at this restaurant called Cracker Barrel. I was a dishwasher in the restaurant, and I was a good dishwasher, but they had too many rules. The supervisor called me in the office one day, and he's like, 'Rod, we need you to take a drug test.' And I was like, 'Whoa, I took a drug test to get the job.' And he was like, 'No, this is a random drug test.' And I was like, 'Well hell, you better pick somebody else then, damn it. This is not a good day to do me. Don't get me wrong, I can pass the test. I just need to study.'
===
A week after I saw this episode, I pull into this convenience store. I'm getting out of my car -- I see that same guy I saw in 'America's Most Wanted' coming out. I freak, right? My heart's pounding. I knew what I had to do. I ran over there and tackled him. I'm hitting him; I'm holding him down. The police showed up, and they arrested me. Apparently, they use actors.
Two prostitutes were riding around town with a sign on top of their car that said: "TWO PROSTITUTES -- $50.00."A policeman stopped them and told them they'd either have to remove the sign or go to jail.Just then, another car passed with a sign saying, "JESUS SAVES."One of the girls asked the cop, "Why don't you stop them?""Well, that's a little different," the cop smiled. "Their sign pertains to religion."The two ladies frowned as they took their sign down and drove off.The following day the cop noticed the same two ladies driving around with a large sign on their car again. This time the sign read: "TWO ANGELS SEEKING PETER -- $50.00."

A police officer in a small town stopped a motorist who was speeding down Main Street.    ''But officer,'' the man said, ''I can explain.''''Just be quiet!!!'' snapped the officer. ''Or I'm going to let you cool off in jail until the chief gets back.''''But officer, I just wanted to say...''''And I said KEEP QUIET!  Now you're going to jail!''A few hours later, the officer checked up on his prisoner and said, ''Lucky for you the chief is at his daughter's wedding.  He'll be in a great mood when he gets here.''''Don't count on it,'' said the prisoner. ''I'm the groom.''
Harold and Lloyd were speeding down the road when a cop pulled them over."You were going eighty!" the officer yelled.  "Why  so fast?""We have a good reason," Lloyd explained to the   cop.     "Our brakes are no good so we wanted to get there   before we had an accident!"
===
I was recently involved in kind of a serious driving accident, which you may have suspected. It was not completely my fault because the other guy involved was really drunk. But he was at a slight disadvantage because he didn't have his car with him at the time.
A police officer asks a thief, "Why did you steal this stranger's watch?"  The thief replies, "I didn't steal it -- he gave it to me!"  The policeman asks, "When did he give it to you?"  The thief tells him, "When I showed him the gun." 
===
Now, that's gotta be a hell of a thing to go to jail for cable. You in there with mass murderers and everybody. 'What you in here for?' 'I killed six people. What you in here for?' 'Comedy Central.'
By the time a Marine pulled into a little town, every hotel room was taken. "You've got to have a room somewhere,"  he pleaded. "Or just a bed, I don't  care where.""Well, I do have a double room with one occupant a Navy guy," admitted the manager, "and he might be glad to split the cost.  But to tell you the truth, he snores so loudly that people in adjoining rooms have complained  in the past.  I'm not sure it'd be worth it to you.""No problem," the tired Marine assured him.  "I'll take it."The next morning the Marine came down to breakfast, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed."How'd you sleep?" asked the manager."Never better."The manager was impressed.  "No problem with the other guy snoring, then?""Nope, I shut him up in no time" said the Marine."How'd you manage that?" asked the manager."He was already in bed, snoring away, when I came in the room," the Marine explained. "I went over, gave him a kiss on the cheek, said, 'Goodnight, beautiful,' and he sat up all night watching me."
===
I was on Oprah Winfrey once, but the cops pulled me off of her, and now she's pressing charges.
You ever notice, in every single cop movie, like halfway through the movie, there's always this scene where the main dude, the cop, will get shot, and then he'll fall, like, 10 stories out of a building, and then he'll be, like, 'Ugh, I'm gettin' too old for this'? And I'm like, was there a time where that was OK? I think that's bad at any point in your life. Has anybody ever been shot and been like, 'Oh my god! I'm exactly the right age for this.'
===
Tried to rip off what he thought was my bicycle. It was an exercycle. He didn't get far.
That's humiliating -- you train your whole life to be a police officer; then they put you on a bicycle like some crazed paper boy?
===
It's just like the movie, 'Sideways' -- they'll drive to the vineyard, drink and drive, and there were no cops anywhere. I'm like, 'That's how you get away with it? I gotta try that in Chicago.' 'You been drinking tonight, sir?' 'No, just tasting. I got some cheese and crackers in the back.'
Being pulled over is no joke. It's scary, but you know what's even worse? Being a passenger in your friend's car when they get pulled over. That's when you start finding out the things about your best friend you never knew existed. 'Damn! Damn! This car is not even registered. I got a handgun in the glove box, cocaine under your seat. I'm wearing a wig, and we've got a dead body in the trunk.'
===
-- I can't reach my license unless you hold my beer.-- Sorry, Officer, I didn't realize I was driving.-- Wow, you must've been doing about 125 mph to keep up with me!-- I was going to be a cop, but I decided to finish high school instead.-- You're not gonna check the trunk, are you?-- You look just like my girlfriend's deadbeat ex-husband.-- The question is -- do YOU know why you pulled me over?-- I was trying to keep up with traffic, and it's miles ahead of me.-- If you have to ask if I've been drinking, I'm not going to tell you, dude.-- It wasn't my fault -- when I reached down to roll this joint, my gun fell off my lap and got lodged under the brake pedal.-- That's a sweet 9mm. You want to hold my .44 magnum?-- If I'd known I was getting a full body cavity search, I would have waxed!
Why did God create women?

This year about five guys got fined $5500 apiece... 'cause they were wearing their shorts past their knees. Does anybody remember the 70s and the 80s? Basketball players used to play in Speedos and halter tops.
I was actually on two reality shows, which is crazy. Just to think that, out there, there was some guy, like flipping through the channels, being like, 'Hey, I 69'd her on a cruise ship.'
===
It's the same thing every week -- every week. What do you think's going to happen? Oh, that guy's got a unibrow. You think they're going to talk about that? He's got cinder block bookshelves. You think that's going to come up?
I love whenever they downgrade a hurricane to a tropical depression, because I always think of a tropical depression as how I feel three songs into a Jimmy Buffett concert.
===
He said, 'Arj, if you're having trouble with www.arjbarker.com, don't call me. You consult the Webmaster.' I said, 'Fine.' So, I called Spiderman.
Can you imagine if you had a pair of shoes that you could only walk in? That could be kind of limiting under certain circumstances. 'Everybody get outta here! There's a swarm of bees coming!' What? Oh great, I got my walking shoes on today. I guess I better stroll the hell out of here at a moderate pace.
===
I heard this guy going around talking about how he was this big rap producer, and he was just going around and boasting and bragging. And in one of those bragging sessions, I heard him just tell somebody, 'Hey, hey -- why don't you try making four beats a day for two summers?' What a dangerously specific challenge that is.
If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends?

What happened when Batman and Robin got run over by a steamroller?
They became Flatman and Ribbon!

People say that one a lot: 'You're a lot bigger than you look on TV.' They say it so often that I am considering hiring a dwarf, whom I will dress up to look exactly like myself, make him walk a little bit ahead of me at all times. People will run up to him and go, 'You're the Cash Cab guy!' And he'll be like, "I know!' And then they will be like, 'You are exactly the same size as you are on television.'
I've been in L.A. about six years. I've already had a series -- series of disappointments.

I don't know if you wanna wear your fuchsia with the persimmons socks and the periwinkle shoes with the avocado hat. What are you -- half human, half crayon?
If you ever see me at a boat show or at a car show, blow my head off.

When I first started doing stand-up, I would be so nervous that I would just binge drink really heavily right before my sets, and as you can imagine, that had its drawbacks. But now I'm a professional, so I pace myself throughout the day.
When I first got into this biz called show, I decided I was going to change my name, make it more Hollywood. And you know how you do that? You take your middle name and the first street that you ever lived on. So when I first started, I actually went by Sue Rural Route 2.
===
I love roller derby. I mean, I've never seen it, but I like that it exists because it cuts down on all the crappy girl bands that would be around otherwise.
Guys don't do that when they go out. Guys don't wear outfits that feature the dong.
===
It's the competition that I think is weird. They're not lifting weights. It's like, 'Alright, Kalkrovich, we fill these grand pianos with molten lead. See how many you can hurl in that third story window in 30 seconds.'
How is a computer like Britney Spears?They're both cheap, white, and plastic.
===
Now that I live there, I actually find that I'm around the people that I can't stand to be around the most, which are these elitist people. You know, hipster people that have an opinion on, like, everything that you should wear and all the cool music you should listen to. They'll critique any movie you like -- you know, as you're watching something, walk into the room and be like, 'Really? Really? You like 'Short Circuit'? The book is better.'
What you have to do is be honest with who you are. Find that thing inside of you that is you and be that. Don't lie and don't perpetrate. I am sick and tired of ugly bitches that wear shirts that say, 'Cutey.'
===
Of course you're nicer than we are, your lives are less stressful. Do you know this? For one thing, what you're wearing tonight will be in style for the rest of your lives.

I was listening to the radio today, and at one point, the deejay, he says: 'In that rock block we just heard Matchbox Twenty, 311, Three Doors Down and Seven Mary Three. Coming up we got Blink 182, Sum 41, Eve Seven, and D12.' I'm like, 'Bingo!'
You know who does it for her? Antonio Banderas. I swear, this guy gets my wife horny. He gets her all wound up. I rent all his movies; he does all the work for me.

Sense of humor? That was number two. What a crock that is! I made some women laugh tonight; I don't see you all going, 'Mmmm, oh comedy boy, oh, talk about your minivan -- you're making me moist.'
Who is the famous artist with brown fingers?
===
It's kind of weird living in L.A. because everyone's so in show business, you know what I mean? This guy gave me his business card the other day, it said 'Actor/Writer/Producer/Director/Rapper.' And he goes, 'Yo dawg, call me for weed.'
I saw a transvestite holding one of those fancy handbags that said 'Guess.' I said, 'You're a man?'
===
For those of you over the age of 25, 'Pimp My Ride' is a show where they take people with bad cars like mine and they give them all this stuff that they don't need. Like, if I went on that show, I'd have very simple instructions. I'd be like, 'Hey, I don't need a hot tub or a water slide or a popcorn maker or an ice machine or a place to perform surgery in my Cutlass. Fix my reverse.'
I'm going to start rapping. I think it fits me. I think the first step to being a good rapper is you got to have a cool rapper name, right? Like Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg -- those are cool names. I think my favorite name is LL Cool J, though, because LL Cool J -- I don't know if you know this -- stands for 'Ladies Love Cool James.' Like, he put it in his name, like, 'Bitches like me, what you got?' Like, that's pretty tight. So, I came up with my own name in the style of his name, but mine's a little bit longer. Mine is LL BJFW Cool DAMTNET, and mine stands for 'Ladies Like Being Just Friends With Cool Daniel and Most Times Not Even That.'
===
The national anthem blows. Are you kidding me? Do any of you have it on your iPod?
The worst television is MTV. 'Music Television' -- they call it that, they don't even play music. How's that legal? What if everybody did that? 'Hey, thanks for calling New York Pizza.' 'Yeah, give me two large pepperoni pizzas.' 'Oh, we don't sell pizza.' 'What?' 'No, we just have  raccoon hats and eye patches. Call a book store if you're hungry.'
===
I think that when you get dressed in the morning, sometimes you're really making a decision about your behavior for the day. Like if you put on flip-flops you're saying, 'Hope I don't get chased today.'
I was at a party the other night, and I saw a guy wearing a leather jacket, and I thought, 'That is cool.' Like 10 minutes later, I saw a guy wearing a leather vest and I thought, 'That is not cool.' That's when I realized cool is all about leather sleeves.

Victoria's Secret debuts $2 million bra. Lady Gaga ordered one in Kobe beef.

One time, I was doing craft services on a dance competition, and there was this little midget break dancing. He finished his thing, and he got up. And I came over; I gave him a big hug. I said, 'Hold me close, you tiny, little dancer.' And that, my friends, is where Elton John got the idea for the song, 'Bennie and the Jets.'
If you don't know what pimping a ride is, basically it means to fix up a car. So, you'd think that it would be a paint job, overhaul the engine, some new tires -- no, not on MTV.  'Cause on MTV, when we pimp your ride, what we do is we take this piece of sh*t car and put in all this unnecessary crap that should never be in a car. We got a Play Station in your steering wheel; we got smoke machines in the speakers; we got "Rubber Ducky" shooting out of the exhaust pipe!
===
They had that red-haired gorilla with the English accent that was their leader. They never explained, if there's no England in the picture, how did he get that accent? You'd think at least one of the monkeys would have been there going, 'Why's he talking that way?'
I wish sometimes that I could lose my temper the way that Charlton Heston did in the original 'Planet of the Apes,' that scene where he says, 'Take your paws off me, you damn dirty apes!' And he did that after they threw a net on him. It's like, before then, everything was OK; something about monkeys throwing a net on him: 'That's it. That's it. Now, I'm angry.'
===
So, I play in a band. It's a really underground band. Super underground. Very underground. Like, we don't even actually play.
I like to go to England, and I'll tell you why. I like to go to a country where I am considered the best-looking person. It's as simple as that. Hollywood, kind of a crushing ego blow -- 'Hey Buddy Holly, you are so old, have you not perished in a plane crash?' But not in England, good God, not there. In England, God bless that dinky island, there it's, 'Good God, look at him. He has all his teeth and his ears are in proportion to his head.' I'm Brad bloody Pitt on that island.

Everything's 'Star Wars' nowadays, isn't it, man? You go out to dinner with a friend. Between their beeping watch, their pager, their cell phone, it's like you're out with R2D2 for the evening.

One day I came home, he was passed out in his Spider-Man outfit in front of the building, and the fire department had to show up with the clear paddles and bring him back to life. What a bad day to be a kid driving by and seeing Spider-Man.
I just get in my elevator one day: there is Spider-Man. I'm like, 'Well, you've gotten a little lazy, haven't you? Remember the old days when you'd take the side of the building?'

I moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles, and it was very scary to move to Los Angeles 'cause I thought that everyone would be mean. I thought there might actually be some shouting on the streets: 'Hey, we're trying to shoot "Charmed." Get the hell out of the way.'

A lot of people think I look like Alec Baldwin. They don't actually tell me that, but I'm pretty sure that's what they're thinking.
I like the real fights, like channel 291, 3:30 in the morning, and it's live -- just some guys beating the tar out of each other. I love those because you can tell they have something at stake. They have, like, rent due tomorrow.

Why is easy listening music so hard to listen to?

Who unplugs a TV -- ever? You plug it in once, and it stays that way 'til you f**king move, alright? There could be a nest of opossums behind my TV, I wouldn't know it 'cause I don't go back there.
They always say that the older you get, you start to lose your memory. I could be watching a TV show for 45 minutes. Then, during commercials, I start flipping through the channels. Then I have to stop and go, 'What the hell was I watching?'

Usually when people think you're gay, it's because the way you dress or talk or the way you're really into house music. And I don't do any of those things. For me, it's like I put one Ben Affleck poster in my bedroom, and everyone starts talking.
All these shows like 'I Want a Famous Face' and 'The Swan' -- basically what that is, is people go on national TV, and they tell America, 'I don't like how I look. I'm so against growing an original personality or developing charm, I'd rather have someone take a knife to my skull.'

That was great because the question was, 'If you could interview any historic American, who would it be and why?' Talk about a deer in headlights, these girls were just terrified. You could read their thoughts, too: 'Maybe if I repeat the question, it will give my pea-sized brain time to formulate an answer. That's what I'll do. I'll repeat the question really slow. If I could interview any historic American, who would it be and why? Sh*t -- not enough time.'

$ Michael Jordan having "retired,"with $40 million in endorsements, makes $178,100 a day, working or not.$ If he sleeps 7 hours a night, he makes$52,000 every night while visions of sugarplums dance in his head.$ If he goes to see a movie, it'll cost him$7.00, but he'll make $18,550 while he's there.$ If he decides to have a 5 minute egg, he'llmake $618 while boiling it.$ He makes $7,415/hr more than minimum wage.$ He'll make $3,710 while watching eachepisode of Friends.$ If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX($90,000) it would take him a whole 12 hours.$ If someone were to hand him his salary andendorsement money, they would have to do it at the rate of $2.00 every second.$ He'll probably pay around $200 for a niceround of golf, but will be reimbursed $33,390 for that round.$ Assuming he puts the federal maximum of 15%of his income into a tax deferred account (401k), his contributions will hit the federalcap of $9500 at 8:30 a.m. on January 1st.$ If you were given a penny for every 10dollars he made, you 'd be living comfortably at $65,000 a year.$ He'll make about $19.60 while watching the100 meter dash in the Olympics, and about $15,600 during the Boston Marathon.$ While the common person is spending about$20 for a meal in his trendy Chicago restaurant, he'll pull in about $5600.$ This year, he'll make more than twice asmuch as all U.S. past presidents for all of their terms combined.Amazing isn't it?  However...$ If Jordan saves 100% of his income for thenext 450 years, he'll still have less than Bill Gates has today.$$$ Game over.  Nerd wins.

Since our lecturers took S.H.I.T. before they graduated, they don't have to do S.H.I.T. anymore, as they are all full of S.H.I.T. already. If you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be intersted in a job teaching others. We can add your name to our BASIC UNDERSTANDING LECTURE LIST (B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T.).For students who are attending to pursue a carrier in management and consultancy, we will refer you to the department of MANAGERIAL OPERATIONAL RESEARCH EDUCATION (M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.).

    A herd of buffalo can only move as fastas the slowest buffalo, and when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones atthe back of the herd that are killed first.  This natural selection is good for theherd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole herd is maintained oreven improved by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way, thehuman brain can operate only as fast as the slowest brain cells through which theelectrical signals pass.Recent emiological studies have shown that while excessive intake of alcohol kills off brain cells, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.   Thus, regular consumption of spirits helps eliminate the weaker cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. The result of this in-depth study verifies and validates the causal link between all-weekend parties and job-related performance. It also explains why, after a few short years of completing universitystudies and then getting married and settling down, most professionals cannot keep up withthe performance of the new graduates.  Only those few that stick to the strictregimen of voracious alcoholic consumption can maintain the intellectual levels that theyachieved during their university years.    So, this is a call to arms.  As ourcountry is losing its technological edge we should not shudder in our homes.  But getback into the bars  and pubs and quaff that pint!  Your company and your countryneeds you to be at your peak, and at your best, and you shouldn't deny yourself the careeropportunities that you could achieve through excessive alcohol consumption.  Takelife by the bottle and be all that you can be! And remember a good  cold beer willkill those bad, useless brain cells that are slowing you  down and it will make thenecessary room needed to get the good brain cells up front and at the top ready to performat their best.  So bottoms up, down  the hatch, look out brain it's coming fast!

The  principal and Harry both agreed.Ms. Brooks asks, "What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?" Harry, after a moment: "Legs."Ms. Brooks: "What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?"  The principal wondered, why would she ask such a question! Harry replied: "Pockets."Ms. Brooks: "What does a dog do that a man steps into?"Harry: "Pants"Ms. Brooks: What's starts with a C, ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin, whitish liquid?Harry: "Coconut."The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.Ms. Brooks: "What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?" The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer.Harry: "Bubble gum"Ms. Brooks: "What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?"Harry: "Shake hands."The principal was trembling.Ms. Brooks: "What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?"Harry: "Firetruck"The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, "Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last seven questions wrong!"

Two guys are hitting the links at their local golf and country club. Luckily, it's a beautiful day, and there's  hardly anyone on the course, so they've been breezing through the holes. Up around the seventh tee, they  spot the first people on the course other than themselves, two ladies who, from the guys' perspective, are having trouble on the green. In fact, they've each five-putted it!The first guy says ''Christ. I hope they just had a bad hole, I don't want to follow these broads for the next eleven holes!'' The second one goes, ''Well, maybe I'll go talk to them, and maybe they can let us pass them. I'll be back in a sec.''So he trots off, about to go and ask to let them pass. Suddenly, about a hundred feet away from the women,  he stops, turns and runs away from them as fast as he can. When he comes back, he exclaims, ''Jesus! That's my  wife and my girlfriend! They're both here! Golfing together! I'm sorry, man, but I can't say anything to them. I'm  liable to be killed if they saw me. How about you go ask them?''So the other guy concurs, and trots off to ask the women if they can pass and get on with their game. Then he stops suddenly, spins around and runs back  to his buddy in the same manner.     ''What's wrong? What's the matter?'' his friend says.    ''Same damn thing,'' he replies.

I found my girlfriend's vibrator. Oh my God -- it was the size of my arm. I was like, 'What are you doing when I'm not here?' She goes, 'Don't worry, I think about you when I use it.' I was like, 'What am I doing -- working the crane that lowers you onto it?'
That porno spam is bad stuff, boy, because I want to delete it, but it's almost like they have a chip in my head or something. Because I get these emails -- they're like: 'Do you like hot, young girls in thigh-high stockings?' Yeah. 'Do you have a credit card?' I sure do. 'Do you want to add three inches onto your penis?' Who's been reading my diary?

I bring you a lovely greeting from California, where we recently failed to legalize marijuana because the Xbox doesn't have a "vote here" function."
If you're still using porno magazines, you're basically telling everyone that you have no idea what the Internet is.

I love text messaging because I love any form of one-sided non-verbal communication. I like to give people information, and then they've got to deal with it.
My phone is awesome. When I'm writing up a text message, it tries to help me out. I'll tap in a couple letters, right? And then the phone will pop up some shadowy-ghosty letters next to the letters I typed in, completing a potential word -- as if to say, 'Is this what you mean?' And sometimes it is, and I say, 'Thanks phone. You have anticipated my needs like an attentive lover.'

10. Their company logo: two tin cans and a length of string. 9. You check out their address, and it's a phone booth containing a Compaq portable and an acoustic coupler. 8. Their chief technical officer lives in a 10-foot-by-7-foot shack in the woods. 7. Their proud boast: "We've been on the Internet since it was CB radio." 6. Their promo materials use the words "information" and "superhighway" in the same sentence. 5.

"As seen in Better Business Bureau special reports." 3. "Access speeds up to 9,600 bps in most areas." 2. They hawk both domain names and Rolexes on street corners. 1. They charge by the word.

I was actually in my car today, and I was just driving, and I noticed a guy on the sidewalk holding a cardboard sign that said, 'Where will you spend eternity?'. And that kind of freaked me out because I was on my way to the DMV.

And, see, all this stuff is turning me into this guy I don't want to be: that grouchy old, get-off-my-yard guy. Remember that guy? He was like 'Ah get off my yard! I hate everyone. I hate kids'. It's making me this grouchy guy and I don't want to be it. But I'll give you a great example. The other day, I was in my car and I got stuck behind a school bus. Now, I don't know if you've been stuck behind a school bus before, but once you're there, you're stuck. I've passed kidney stones quicker than you can get around a school bus.

Every New Yorker makes the same mistake: we take a 10-day vacation. It's the worst thing we could ever do. You take a four-day vacation. If you get 10, take six in New York and four on the road because New Yorkers can't last outside New York for more than four days.

We got stuck in traffic. We sat there for 30-40 minutes without moving an inch. By the time I got up to where the accident was, there was nothing there -- God, that pisses me off.

Sometimes I get drunk and I get into arguments with taxi drivers. And I get out the cab and I slam the door. That's not the way to win an argument with a taxi driver. The way to win is you get out of the cab and you leave the door open.

I was driving in Manhattan. There's traffic, nobody's moving... The guy behind me is honking just at me. He kept yelling at me. I decided that I'm gonna argue with this guy, but I'm gonna argue about something else. I'm not having his argument; I'm having mine. So, he's like, 'Go!' And I go, 'Well give me back my jacket!' And he stopped. I was like, 'Yeah, you got my jacket! Give it back! I said you could borrow it, not have it! You're stretching it out, you fat pig! Give it back, now!' He got back in his car, and he locked his doors.

We're still selfish on the plane. I'm on the plane in San Francisco last week, the pilot comes on, he goes, 'We have a problem with engine number two. There's going to be about a 45 minute delay.' Everybody on the plane goes, 'Come on, let's go!' Yeah -- let's take off with that screw missing on engine number two, so I can be sitting in a cornfield in Nebraska three hours from now with burnt balls and a bag of peanuts 'cause you were late for your Amway meeting in Syracuse.

They flew me out in this plane that was only first class. It was all first class. It was the most psychotic thing I've ever seen in my life. The drinking that went on -- it was like Mardi Gras. The nose of the plane started to develop red veins.

They can get rid of page three, that's the water landing section. There is no useful information there. At the top, they show you how to use your seat-bottom cushion as a flotation device.

The he gets on his moped, the other guy gets into his 'Vette, and they both leave the parking lot.      The guy in the Corvette decides to show off and race out of the parking lot.  He stops at a stop light.  Enjoying his music he looks out the window and sees the guy on the moped flying by at about 80 mph!  He can't believe a moped can go that fast!  So he races up to the guy on the moped and passes him again to show how fast he can go. At the next stop light, the guy on the moped speeds by once more.      Finally the Corvette and moped stop at the same stop light.  ''How the hell did you go past me so fast like that!?''  the guy in the Corvette asks.    The guy on the moped, all flushed and pale, looks at the man and says, ''MY SUSPENDERS ARE CAUGHT IN YOUR CAR DOOR!!!!''

I don't like driving here in Los Angeles too much. I hate the left-hand turn arrow, especially, because it creates a very tense situation when we line up, waiting for that left arrow to turn from red to green. And it's fine for the person in the front, and when it turns green, that guy never seems to go -- I don't know why. I don't know if it's the power: knowing there are people behind them, and they're controlling people's lives? And the psychology is interesting 'cause the guy in the number two spot, he won't honk 'cause he figures, 'Hey, I'm getting through.' But the further back you get, the more tense it becomes... So I'm in sixth. I honk. The guy in front of me flips me off. I'm like, 'What? I'm not even honking at you -- I'm looping around you.'
My best friend got a truck. She didn't want to be so trendy, so she got a UPS truck. You might laugh, but she can park it anywhere.

The genie says, "OK, go outside, and your wish will be granted."The man goes outside, but all he finds are ducks filling the sky and roads. He goes back in and tells his friend what happend, and his friend replies, "I know. Did you really think I wanted a 12-inch pianist?"

When the bartender asks what's wrong, the man says, "I just found out that my youngest son is gay, too!"On the third day, the guy comes into the bar and orders another six double vodkas.

I saw a security guard the other day sleeping at 2 p.m., like a baby... I haven't slept like a baby in 10 years because I'm up thinking about stuff -- like goals. This guy had the right attitude: 'I've failed. Oh well. Night-night.'

She gave my penis an awesome nickname. I don't mean to brag, but she used to call my penis 'Microsoft.' I know, right? That's a huge company, dude.

Actually, I'll be honest with you folks, before I came here tonight, I laid off a few million employees from Microsoft back at my hotel room.

When you work in an office, they have a lot of bogus incentives, right? They're like, 'If you work hard this week, next Friday is going to be jeans day! Yeah, jeans!'

I hate it when people don't do their jobs. It's rampant in this country today. There's a company -- you know by their name they're not going to do anything: U-Haul.
If you sell things over the phone, the dream went awry somewhere, and you're working in a sweat box trying to make quota so you can buy some speed.

Self-employed.
We got interns at the job. You can just tell them to do stuff. You gotta be nice, though. I had this cat fax something. I handed him a couple of pages, and I handed him another page. I said, 'Hey, man, fax something for yourself, too.'

I wasn't always a comic. Before I did this, I was a house painter for five years. Five years -- I didn't think I'd ever finish that house.
Even if you like New York, you'll admit it's not a nice place. It does things to a person. My uncle -- 10 years ago, this guy was a prominent judge in Manhattan; now, he's a wino living in Central Park. But out of respect people still say, 'May I approach the bench?' And that's sweet.
===
Couple days a week, I go to an office. And I don't want to throw my success in your face, but I have my own cubicle. How do you like me now, bitches?
I knew some people who lost their jobs after 30 years of work. They went in their cubicle, and they had a note that said, 'Get yo' ass out.' And they're like, 'Get yo' ass out -- what is this? What am I supposed to do?' 'Uh, you supposed to get yo' ass out.' 'But I been here 30 years.' 'We'll give you 30 minutes.' 'What about job security?' 'They'll be up here in five.'
===
I'm into something called 'sensual harassment.' It's a lot like sexual harassment, but it lasts eight hours.
The guy came up to me, my manager, the first day and said, 'I want you to go to all the tables, scrape the gum off with a butter knife.' And I was thinking, 'I'm not doing that. I'm definitely not doing it.' But I thought, why just say, 'No! The hell with you!' and get fired? That's boring. Instead I said to him, 'Yeah, OK. I'll do it.' Then, I didn't do it, and he came up to me later: 'Did you scrape the gum off the tables?' I was like, 'Oh, yeah, of course I did, sure.' And later, he comes up, he goes, 'You didn't scrape the gum off the tables?' I'm like, 'Ah! No. Damn.' 'Are you gonna do it?' 'Yeah, of course I'm gonna do it.' Three days later, I got fired. I got paid for three days.

I don't really do, like, a big exploding joke at the end 'cause this is a job and I treat it just like you treat your job. Whatever it is you do for eight hours a day, right before you clock out, you don't start doing yours extra good, do you?
In show business, it takes 10 years to create an overnight success. You've heard that, right? But what you don't hear is that that's the exact same amount of time it takes to create a bitter failure.

My supervisor -- let's call him Greenbean -- said that there were certain bigwigs who you should never put on hold, certain VIPs who you should never put on hold, and I could never remember who those people were. So, I put everyone on hold and I conferenced them, and I let them sort it out amongst themselves.
My friends from L.A. stop me and say, 'Maria, you already do so much. You make people laugh; it's the greatest gift in the world.' I only do that, like, four minutes a day, if it's going well. Maybe in the off-time, I could sponge bathe the dying or just hose things off a little bit.

Folks, you say what you want about the crackheads, but when they're hard up for a fix, they are good workers. This guy raked my entire yard with a fork in 11 minutes.
It's been a couple of years since I actually worked in an office, so I thought I should do something to prepare to get back into the typing, filing and phone answering, and what not. So what I did was I had a friend of mine go with me down to the local swimming pool, and I had him tie me up in a burlap sack and sink me to the bottom of the pool. And then just as I was about to suffocate, he yanked me up and gave me a lunch break.
===
I remember one time one of my friends was like, 'Hey man, can you put in a good word for me over at the McDonald's?' I was like, 'I can tell them you're alive.'
Whenever I walk, people try to hand me out fliers, and when someone tries to hand me out a flier, it's kinda like they're saying, 'Here, you throw this away.'
===
You ever been to a comedy club? Not a very classy environment. They always have a two drink minimum. They force you to drink 'cause they're very insecure that the show might suck. They're like, 'Come on in -- this guy's hilarious, as long as you are f**ked up the whole time.' Can you imagine another business trying to pull that? You go to a restaurant; they're like, 'Come on in, the food's great here. Before you eat it, you got to smoke some weed. Yeah, we just serve Hot Pockets up in this bitch. But if you're high it, doesn't suck as much.'
If you work in porn, I don't know if you and your coworkers know this, but we have enough porn. You don't have to keep making it. You did a great job, we appreciate your service, but you can shut it down.

I applied for a job at a construction crew once -- a lot of big, burly guys there. The foreman said, 'You can have this job, just fill this out,' and he handed me a shirt.
I'll never forget the time they gave me a farewell party at work. I was so surprised -- I didn't even know I was fired.

A retired US Marine was looking for a new job. He finally found one that appealed to his interests. At the interview, he was asked,"Do you have any military experience?"The Marine replied, "Why, yes! I've been in the Marines for a couple of years.""I see," said the interviewer, "any disabilities?"The Marine looked at him and replied shakily. "Well... In the Vietnam War I had a grenade go off between my legs, blowing off my testicles."The interviewer, quite shocked, said "All right, you're hired. Please report to work on Monday at 10:00am.""Wait wait!" shouted the Marine, "When do the others start? I don't want any special treatment just because of my disability."The interviewer replied, "Well... I'll tell you the truth. Everyone normally comes at 7:00 in the morning, but nothing gets done until 10. All we do is sit around, scratching our nuts trying to figure out what to do."
I went to a drug dealer's funeral. He was so big-time, his beeper was still going off.

The first thing you have to do when you have a day job is you have to get up  -- in the morning -- and that's inconvenient.
I'm not a good eight-hour worker because I don't think you should have to be around people that long that you don't know. That's not a good thing. You be like, 'I don't know these people. Why am I here this long? I don't think it takes eight hours to do nothing. We should not be around each other this long.'

That's how little I know about the economy: I think the Kool Aid Man sits at the head of the table in the board meeting: 'I think we should sell some shares!' Ok, Kool Aid Man -- you're in charge. Your ice never melts.
I used to get up and go to work; I just don't like supervisors. Supervisors are always asking you stupid questions: 'Why you always late for work?' I'm like, ''Cause it make the day go faster. The later I get here, the quicker this end.'
===
1.  Never give me work in the morning.  Always wait until 4:00 and then bring it to me.  The challenge of a deadlineis refreshing.2.  If it's really a rush job, run in andinterrupt me every 10 minutes to inquire how it's going.  That helps.  Or evenbetter, hover behind me, advising me at every keystroke.3.  Always leave without telling anyonewhere you're going.  It gives me a chance to be creative when someone asks where youare.4.  If my arms are full of papers, boxes,books, or supplies, don't open the door for me.  I need to learn how to function as aparaplegic and opening doors with no arms is good training in case I should ever beinjured and lose all use of my limbs.5.  If you give me more than one job todo, don't tell me which is priority.  I am psychic.6.  Do your best to keep me late.  Iadore this office and really have nowhere to go or anything to do.  I have no lifebeyond work.7.  If a job I do pleases you, keep it asecret.  If that gets out, it could mean a promotion.8.  If you don't like my work, telleveryone.  I like my name to be popular in conversations.  I was born to bewhipped.9.  If you have special instructions fora job, don't write them down. In fact, save them until the job is almost done.  Nouse confusing me with useful information.10.  Never introduce me to the peopleyou're with.  I have no right to know anything.  In the corporate food chain, Iam plankton.  When you refer to them later, my shrewd deductions will identify them.11.  Be nice to me only when the job I'mdoing for you could really change your life and send you straight to managers' hell.12.  Tell me all your little problems.  No one else has any and it's nice to know someone is less fortunate.  Iespecially like the story about having to pay so much taxes on the bonus check youreceived for being such a good manager.13.  Wait until my yearly review and THENtell me what my goals SHOULD have been. Give me a mediocre performance rating  with a cost of living increase. I'm not here for the money anyway.
If my penis were, say, an annual salary: $47,000 a year with dental. That's pretty good. $47,000 -- plenty, ladies, if you just, uh, tighten up your budget. Have a tight budget. Don't just have a loose skanky ass budget.

10.  You're so tired you now answer the phone,   'Hell.'    9.  Your friends call to ask how you've been, and   you immediately scream, 'Get off my back, bitch!'    8.  Your garbage can IS your 'in' box.    7.  You wake up to discover your bed is on fire,   but go back to sleep because you just don't care.    6.  You have so much on your mind, you've   forgotten how to pee.    5.  Visions of the upcoming weekend help you make   it through Monday.    4.  You sleep more at work than at home.    3.  You leave for a party and instinctively bring your ID badge.    2.  You blasted your Daily Planner with a .357   Magnum a week ago, but still haven't been able to   miss a meeting.    1.  You think about how relaxing it would be if  you were in jail right now.
A man was walking down the street when he came upon a brothel. He noticed a couple having sex on the lawn. He saw another couple behind a tree and two more behind some bushes.He walked up to the brothel, knocked on the door and asked what in the world was going on with all the sex on the lawn. "Oh, that," said the madam. "We're having a yard sale."

Two weeks ago was my forty-fifth birthday, and I wasn't feeling too hot that morning anyway. I went to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say Happy Birthday, and probably have a present for me.She didn't even say Good Morning, alone any Happy Birthday. I thought, Well, that's wives for you. Maybe the children will remember.The children came in to breakfast and didn't say a word.When I started to the office I was feeling pretty low and despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary, Janet, said, Good morning boss, Happy Birthday.  And I felt a little better; someone had remembered.I worked until noon. Then Janet knocked on my door and said, You know, it's such a beautiful day outside and it's your birthday, let's go to lunch, just you and me. I said, By George, that's the best thing I've heard all day. Let's go.We went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally go; we went out into the country to a little private place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously.On the way back to the office, she said, You know, it's such a beautiful day. We don't need to go back to the office, do we? I said, No, I guess not. She said, Let's go to my apartment. After arriving at her apartment she said, Boss, if you don't mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something more comfortable.Sure, I excitedly replied. She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes, she came out carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my wife, children and dozens of our friends. All were singing Happy Birthday and there on the couch I sat... naked.

Where do one legged people work?IHOP!!
For a couple years I've been blaming it on iron poor blood, lack of vitamins, dieting and a dozen other maladies. Now I found out the real reason.  I'm tired because I'm overworked.The population of this country is 237 million. 104 million are retired. That leaves 133 million to do the work.There are 85 million in school, which leave 48 million to do the work.Of this, there are 29 million employed by the federal government.This leaves 19 million to do the work.Four million are in the Armed Forces, which leaves 15 million to do the work.Take from the total the 14,800,000 people who work for State and City Government and that leaves 200,000 to do the work.There are 188,000 in hospitals, so that leaves 12,000 to do the work.Now, there are 11,998 people in Prisons. That leaves just two people to do the work.You and me . . . and you're sitting there reading jokes.

What's the difference between a wife and a job?After ten years the job still sucks!
Two young men with equal qualifications apply for the same job. In order to determine which individual to hire, the manager gives them a written test.Both men score nine out of 10 on the test; however, the manager decides to go with the first applicant."Why would you do that?" asks the rejected second  applicant. "We both got nine questions correct.""Your fellow applicant wrote 'I don't know' for question five. You put down, 'Neither do I.'"

I think the first thing I'm going to do when I get back upstairs after the show is tear off my wife's underwear. And I'll tell you why --  because they are crushing my balls.
===
I'm 32 years old. Luckily, I have the body of a 14-year-old girl. Yeah, don't tell me that's not cool.
From time to time, my mother puts on her wedding dress. Not because she's sentimental, she just gets really far behind on her laundry.
===
Just when I start to feel pretty and feel good about myself, someone always brings me right back down to Earth. My friend's mom was like, 'Chelsea,' she was so excited, 'I saw an ugly Chelsea on the street the other day.' I'm like, 'Basically what that translates to, is that you saw an ugly person and you thought of me.' Thanks.
Women do it all the time to look younger and it would make perfect sense if one of them ever came out looking younger -- but they don't. They just look the same; they all get plastic surgery face. No matter who they look like going in, they all come out looking like the girl from the band on 'The Muppet Show.'
===
Recently started flat ironing my ball hair. Come on ladies, you know how it is; if you have curly hair you just want straight hair.
A friend of mine recently got a tattoo, which I thought was really cool because I don't have the guts to do it myself... And I asked her where she got it. And she told me she got it on her vagina. And I said, 'Why? Why on God's green earth would you do such a thing?' And she said, 'Well, men find it sexy.' OK, if you're at the point where a man is looking at your naked genitals, guess what -- you got the job.
===
I realize that age ain't nothing but a number, but it is also a very accurate barometer of how old you are.
They should raise the alcohol age to 60, so at least you'd have something to look forward to at this point.
===
You know you're too high when you're eating cereal naked and your girlfriend says, 'Put your clothes on,' and then you realize it's not your girlfriend, it's some woman on a bus.
I have found some ways to use feminism to my own advantage -- mostly to remain lazy and disgusting.
===
How do you make five pounds of fat look good to a man?
Put a nipple on it.
===
Thirty-two is weird because I'm not really young anymore, but I'm not really old yet. I'm kinda stuck in that awkward in-between stage where my hair is just starting to fall out, but I'm still maintaining my youthful acne. So, physically it's all really coming together for me right now. Soon, I'll be strolling around in a pair of Depends, popping zits on my bald head.
Sometimes I wear two wallets so it looks like I have an ass.
===
I went to the tanning salon a couple of weeks ago, this place called Tantastic. I had never been in my life. I didn't know how the whole tanning process worked. I go in -- stupid girl that works there didn't tell me where those little goggles go; I accidentally put them on my nutsack. I got home that night, got naked in front of my lady friend. She kicked me right between the legs -- thought a giant dragonfly was loose in the room.
I start shaving myself, and with every stroke, it's looking more and more pathetic down there, you know? It's like, 'Oh my God, I look like a 12-year-old boy.' So, you know, I left sideburns.
===
You look in my underwear drawer, and it's just, like -- that is to protect my pants from my ass.
I like working out, but I can't stand the characters in the public gym. No matter what city I'm in, there's always the same people in there. There's always that one guy that's figured out the quickest way to look real big without actually training with weights is to squeeze his weird body into the smallest shirt he could possibly find. And you see him in there, and you're like, 'Damn, Bobby, you're looking huge! Wait a minute, what's that shirt say? Daddy's Little Princess?'
===
Now I keep reading that I'm over the hill sexually. I don't even remember having a sexual peak when I was 19; I just remember apologizing a lot.
Once you hit 30, your life changes -- all the 30-year-olds know what I'm talking about. You hit 30, you don't run for the bus anymore. You get about halfway and go, 'Oh, there's other buses. I'm 30, this is garbage. I'm taking a cab to the bus.'
===
I have brown hair and I wear these glasses, and I usually have my hair up in a bun, so the other thing guys have often said to me is, 'You're like a sexy librarian. You're like a sexy librarian type. You're a sexy librarian.' And I'm like, 'I've always thought of myself as more of a bookish whore. Sort of, you know, less of a nerd, more of a slut.'
I'm not gonna tell you how old I am. Let's just say it's somewhere between 30 and a Wal-Mart greeter.
===
Women reach their sexual peak after 35 years. Men reach theirs after about four minutes.
What kind of tattoo would a librarian get? 'Books kick ass'? 'Shut the f**k up and read'?
===
This is day 14 of my head held hostage by this god awful haircut.
The penis, when you pull the underwear down -- it's like a drunk friend just falling out of a car.
===
Make sure you laugh normally. My grandfather, very scary -- big Italian grandfather, very scary laugher. You don't know if he's gonna blackout, cave in or throw up on you when he laughs.
There are guys that think I'm a babe. They don't say it in English, but I know what they mean.
===
I need glasses really bad, and it turns out I can't wear them, medically, because my eyebrows are too g**damn big. I'm not wearing glasses. And I got big nostrils, also. It looks like I have a beard, but that is the shadow of my nostrils. If I wear glasses, it's gonna look like my eyebrows and nose came with my damn glasses. I'm not living my life like that.
There are simple things I love about a woman. I love it when you smile, especially when you have teeth.
===
Personally, I've never been interested in backdoor sex. You know why? Because it's all I can do to keep the front entrance nice for company -- you know, sweeping the walk, trimming the hedge.
You ever see somebody so old they got to take off their glasses just to hear you?

My manager was saying that it might be time for me to get Botox, and I said, 'Oh I don't know, I'm kinda still using my face.'
===
We have to shave our armpits. Whose idea was that? That's a concave area with a straight razor. Could we invent something? Because the best I can do is a mohawk.
This is a card I sent my sister Gina. I drew a picture on the cover just in case she didn't know what she looked like. In case you guys don't know what she looks like, she has 45 teeth and a rare condition where her nostrils are slightly below her nose, and she's always holding a pennant that says 'Gina.'
===
I turned 28. Tell you, I've actually been having sex with a lot of older women lately -- 'cause it's really easy to do.
What are they doing about the mysterious hole discovered at the Carefree Nudist Camp?
===
I swear all the time, and that's how I'm going to be when I'm old. My grandson's going to be like, 'Hey grandpa. We're going to go to the zoo. Do you want to go to the zoo?' 'Oh what, the zoo? Oh f**k that. I'm not f**king going to the zoo.'
It's hard having a big nose. All my pullover shirts have stretch marks.
===
Hair that stands straight up on your head.
L.A. has some pretty tough beauty standards, if I don't say so myself. Because in Oregon, on a good day, I'm like a six or a seven -- I'm not trying to brag -- but in Los Angeles, I'm a man.
===
A woman wants a facelift and her surgeon tells her about a new procedure. "We put a dial in the back of your head and when your skin starts to sag you simply turn the knob.""That sounds good," she says.Two years later, she goes back and tells the surgeon that the dial is giving her bags under her eyes."I'm sorry," replies the surgeon, "but those aren't bags -- those are your tits.""Oh," says the woman, "well that explains the goatee."
I'm a positive person. To me, going bald is not about hair loss, it's about face gain. It's not a receding hairline, it's an advancing facial frontier. It's exciting... One day I'll have a whole head of face.

I am too old to be sneaking into a bitch's house to have sex with her son on a twin bed. Do you know how hard it is to have sex on a twin bed? To try to keep your balance on a bed with some Star Wars sheets on it?
An old woman says to an old man at the rest home, "I can guess your age."The man doesn't believe her, but tells her to go ahead and try."Pull down your pants," she says.She inspects his rear end for a few minutes and then says, "You're 84 years old.""That's amazing," the man says. "How did you know?""You told me yesterday."
===
You know the worst thing about having a weak chin? It takes me about three to four hours to change a pillow case.
As far as I can tell, that is the only real advantage to being me -- that I never have to see me, ever, 'cause my eyes are up on my head. If they were on my leg, I could go, 'Oh, he's goofy looking,' but I thankfully cannot do that.
===
A boner.
I used to live out here myself. One thing I couldn't get used to: everybody with the blonde-blonde hair, dark tan, white teeth. Everybody looks like negatives.
===
You know when I think it's hardest to be a girl? I think it's summertime -- hot weather. For a woman, it's hard to maintain the high vertical clearance on the poofy do in hot weather, especially if you have one of those bitchin' bang-babe-erecto-do things, where they look like they have big hair from the front, and they turn to the side, and they have that Klingon warhead headbutting weapon.
What do cool guys do when they get a Corona? They'll press the lime down into the bottle and then they turn the bottle upside down, so the lime slowly floats upwards to the bottom of the bottle. By the time they turn it back around, usually they're having sex with a woman.
===
I'm keeping in shape, you know, gotta look good for the ladies -- and certain guys. Hey, I can't control who's looking. I just gotta bring the heat.
My sister's a personal trainer. That's a tough job. I don't think I can do that. You gotta help people with their fitness goals. 'Can you help me define my abs?' 'Yeah -- disgusting, sloppy, gelatinous.'

A guy gets stopped by the bouncer at a nightclub. "You have to wear a tie," the bouncer tells him. The guy goes back to his car and finds a set of jumper cables, ties them around his neck and goes back to the club.The bouncer lets him in but warns, "I'll be watching, so you better not start anything!" 
My grandmother is older than the word 'supper.'
===
I saw a commercial the other day for a girdle. And you know what that is, right? That's deception, ladies. These are the same women that get mad when guys lie to them. 'I thought you were single.' 'I thought you were slim.'
Ladies, my whole point is do not -- do not -- feel like you gotta do these tricks for us. Don't -- 'cause the average guy does not care. Do we? No, we don't. As long as the hole is safe and clean -- seriously.

A guy is at a urinal in a public restroom when a hunchback walks in and stands next to him.  He glances over and sees that the hunchback has a gigantic penis.The guy says, "Man, if I had a d**k that big, I would be sucking it all day."The hunchback replies, "How do you think I got to be a hunchback?"
I love being in my 30s: I figured out my past; I kind of know where I'm going. But I found a gray hair, and that completely flipped me out 'cause it was the first one on my chest.

When you take it off, you wonder where her boobs went.

The man then calls the bartender over and asks him if he keeps talking to him.The bartender replies, "It's not me; it's the complimentary peanuts."

For years and years, Arj Barker was high on life, but eventually, I built up a tolerance.
In Los Angeles, if you want to meet someone, you've got to call 11 people, tell them all specifically, 'I'm going to meet you at the movie theater.' And maybe one or two kind of show up and one by accident who happened to be in the neighborhood.
===
You ever say the wrong thing? Like maybe you pass someone you know on the street, unexpectedly, and as you go by, you're trying to play it cool, but you screw it up? And you accidentally answer the question that you thought they were going to ask you instead of the one they really asked? You're walking by. They're like, 'Hey, what's going on?' You're like, 'Pretty good!'
Recently learned how to make solitaire into a drinking game...You just sit there with a deck of undealt cards and think about how lonely you are.
===
Cocaine is yucky. I did it once: I was at a party; I was bored. I was like, 'Alright, I'll do a line.' Then I was just bored longer.
Certain things as men that you don't do. Like, guys, when you're out with your friends and you drop your buddy off, you don't wait to see if he got in OK. You leave; it's uncomfortable. If he gets his ass kicked on the way to the door, that's his own fault. He should learn how to fight.
===
I also smoke a lot of pot, occasionally, every day.
You're better friends than we are. Think about it: men seem to have friendships that last for years. You know why? You guys don't talk to each other.
===
They come over and they go, 'Why don't you come over on Friday night? We're gonna have a bunch of people over. We're gonna have game night. It's gonna be nutty.' Unless we're playing 'Who's Hiding the Ecstasy?' I'm not gonna make it, OK? 'Cause that's my favorite game.
I recently had sex with a midget. Not on purpose -- he was a tricky little f**ker. He kept giving me shot after shot after shot of tequila and would keep getting taller and taller and taller.
===
I don't believe in right or left; I don't believe in Santa or Satan. I believe in things I can touch -- like vodka and Oreos.
Why was the skeleton so cool?
===
Yesterday morning, I was in the park; I saw this old man doing tai chi. I was like, 'That is beautiful.' Then I look closer, and it wasn't an old man doing tai chi. It was one of those heroin guys that never falls over.
I don't know if you know this about me, but once a year, instead of giving one homeless guy a dollar, I step it up. I buy $50 bucks worth of malt liquor, hide it in the park.
===
They say behind every strong man is a strong woman. Well, behind every f**k-up is a best friend saying, 'Go for it, bro!'
I smoke pot sometimes every day.
===
I lost my fog machine 'cause I left it running for too long. I don't know how fog got associated with partying. 'This weather is way too dangerous to drive in. You guys want to dance?'
When you have a fat friend, there are no see-saws, only catapults.
===
Surprise parties are strange 'cause people jump up and they yell the word, 'surprise' at the party. I came home and you emerged from my furniture. You don't have to tell me how to feel. I don't need a hint.

We don't want any pot-smoking vaginas because that's disgusting. And I saw it once in Indonesia, and I've never been able to get it out of my head.
My father never slept, never slept -- oh, he used to rest his eyes quite a bit. He'd never admit he was sleeping... So I tried to throw this back at him: 'No Dad, I'm not ignoring you, I'm resting my ears.' 'No Dad, I'm not drunk, I'm resting my ability to make sound decisions.'

A man was walking down the street and on the   corner were 3 drunks trying to raise a telephone   pole.  They worked and worked and finally got the   thing in the air. Two of of the drunks held the   pole and the other climbed on top.  He let down a   a tape measure.  This fellow couldn't take it any   more so he asks what they were doing.  They said,   ''We are measuring this pole.''      The man asks, ''Why didn't you measure it on the   ground?''      They said, ''We know how long it is, now we want to know how tall it is.''
===
A guy runs into a bar and says, "Bartender, quick!  Give me 20 shots of your best Scotch!"So the bartender lines up 20 shots of his best Scotch and watches this guy down one after the other."Man," the bartender says, "I've never seen anyone drink shots that fast!""You'd drink them that fast too if you have what I have," the guy says."Oh my God," says the bartender, "what do you have?""50 cents."
I only drink when it's a special occasion. Like when it's someone's birthday on Facebook.

Jeff Dunham: It's a great city, great state.Walter: Ok, what's the theater?Jeff Dunham: Pabst.Walter: As in, beer?Jeff Dunham: That's right.Walter: That's just great. If the show sucks, we'll all get wasted.
My best friend in life has never had an orgasm. I seriously mean my best friend -- not me, my best friend -- like, another person, my best friend. I finally decided that I was gonna solve this problem for her by buying her a vibrator. 'Cause wouldn't that solve the problem? So, for her birthday, I went out, got one, wrapped it up, gave it to her, and I was like, 'Here you go. Enjoy -- wink, wink. Call me in a few days.' I let a week go by, and I called her up, and I'm like, 'Hey Lisa, how's it going?' Obviously, Lisa's not her real name -- it's Lisa Katz. She goes, 'It didn't work.' I was like, 'What do you mean it didn't work? It was a very expensive vibrator. I'll return it.' She's like, 'No, no, it functioned fine, but it didn't work for me. It didn't solve my problem.' At that moment, I realized that because I was the one who had bought her the vibrator, I kinda felt like I was the guy who hadn't screwed her the right way. I found myself saying all the things that guys say in that situation. I was like, 'Uh, this has never happened to me before. Maybe it's just the first time? Give it another chance. I've given this to a lot of people and no one's ever complained.' Then, she was like, 'Hey, don't worry about it. This happens to everyone. I like you for you -- it's not a big deal.' And that's when I hung up and never called her again because I don't need that frigid bitch in my life.
===
I don't wanna say she's on medication, but she has an Elvis Pez dispenser with valium in it.
I was on a wine tasting tour once in northern California, in Napa, and the woman's talking about acidification and oxygenation and fermentation. And I'm basically thinking, 'Great. Where's the free wine? Let's talk about my dehydration. I've had enough of your presentation. Let's get going on my intoxication.'
===
I'm all for porn, but don't share it. I go over my friend's house, 'Dude, I got this killer new porn. Wanna watch it?' 'Not together, really, that's weird. What's that gonna do to our relationship?'
Percentage wise, it is 100% easier not to do things than to do them, and so much fun not to do them -- especially when you were supposed to do them. In terms of instant relief, canceling plans is like heroin.

Sometimes I can't tell if I love drinking or hate myself.
I'd like to meet the guy that invented beer, and then buy that dude a beer.

My uncle's actually from Brooklyn, New York. He has a thick New York accent. Like instead of saying, 'What time is it?,' he'll say, 'Get outta here -- I'm drunk.'
When you're drinking a lot and you're a guy, your equipment gets all screwed up. Half the time, it's not ready to have sex. But what's weird is, if you're a guy, your penis will trick you into trying anyway. You're like, 'There's no way I can do this.' And then your penis will be like, 'Put me in, coach!'
===
The BYOB strip club fills a very important niche in the strip club market. Because, I mean, we've all been at a traditional strip club, and the wine list is pedestrian. You know, half the whites from California, they're all screw tops and the sommelier couldn't tell a Sancerre from a sandwich. And I'm just sitting there the whole time thinking, 'I have in my cellar at home a 2002 Argentinean Malbec that would go perfectly with that 42-year-old's hysterectomy scars.'
I saw like four or five news reports, and they were like, 'There's a new drug. It's called "cheese." Kids in the Midwest are doing it. It's an epidemic. It's a new drug. It's an epidemic. It's a new drug.' So, I looked up what cheese is -- cheese is flu medicine and heroin. So really, it's heroin.

A drunken man staggered into a Catholic church, sat down in the Confessional and said nothing.  The priest  is waiting and waiting and waiting.  The priest coughs to attract the drunk man's attention, but still the man says nothing.  The priest then knocks on the wall three times in a final attempt to  get the man to speak.  Finally the drunk replies, ''No use knockin,' pal.  There's no paper."
===
Young guys go chasing women every night. You do that, you're called party animals. Do that in middle age, you're called a lonely alcoholic.
You know that show 'Remember the 80s?' I'm glad they made it 'cause I forgot half the crap that I did.
===
I told my sister how much I was going out down there, and she said that there was this club I should check out. I was like, 'Oh God, not another club.' She's like, 'Yeah, it's called AA.' I thought it was nice of her to worry, but my car never breaks down.
I went to a dance club the other day, which was timely because my self-esteem had been hovering around normal, and I'd been meaning to knock it down to negative 1000.
===
Don't do drugs; don't do it -- especially heroin. Heroin's like having oral sex and, at the same time, a puppy's licking your face. You don't want that.
There's not a guy in here that could call his boy up at three o'clock in the morning. Hell, you can't call your boy up at three in the afternoon because right then and there... he'll be laughing his ass off. And if anybody's around, he'll be like, 'Yo, dawg, you gotta hear this. I'm gonna put it on speaker. Mike is crying!'

A man walks into a bar. The bartender says to the guy, "What can I get you?""Make it a whiskey," says the man who promptly throws it down in one gulp."That will be three dollars," says the bartender."Screw you!" says the man. "You offered to get me something. I thought you were paying.""Get out," says the bartender. "You're banned. I don't need your crap."Two years later, the same man walks into same bar with the same bartender.The bartender looks at him and says, "You're the a**hole who tried to con a drink out of me, aren't you?""Excuse me, but I have no idea what you are talking about," says the customer. "I've never been to this bar before in my life!""Sorry.  My mistake," says the bartender. "You must have a double.""Hey thanks, dude!" says the customer. "Make it whiskey." 
When you move to LA to get into show biz, all your friends from back home warn you that you're going to become shallow and superficial. But I don't really worry about it, 'cause I don't even talk to those friends anymore.

Everybody loves pot brownies. But I bring crystal meth cupcakes to a party, suddenly I'm the weirdo.
The whole first week, I thought I was psychic. I thought I had new powers all of a sudden, you know. I'd be like, 'Where are my keys? Oh, they're in my pocket.' How did I know that? Oh my gosh!
===
I think the saddest part about going out drinking by yourself is tagging yourself in all the pictures the next day.
If something is inherently funny, it's relatable after the fact. Anyone who says, 'You had to be there,' should just not have told you the thing in the first place because it's not funny.
===
A man walks into a bar and says,"Excuse me, I'd like a pint of beer." The bartender serves the drink andsays, "That'll be four dollars."  The customer pulls out a twenty-dollarbill and hands it to the bartender."Sorry, sir," the bartendersays, "but I can't accept that." The man pulls out a ten-dollar bill and thebartender rejects his money again. "What's going on here?" the man asks.Pointing to a neon sign, the bartenderexplains, "This is a Singles Bar."

A cop pulls over a car that's been swerving across the lanes of a road."Get out of the car, please.""But I'm not drunk, officer!""Listen, it doesn't matter if you're drunk or not. If you don't get out of this car, I'll arrest you anyway.""Fine," says the man and gets out of the car."Okay, now walk this yellow line." The man looks at the line."Which one of them do I walk on?"
We're at this bar, and I'm talking to this guy. He's kind of leaning in like maybe he's intrigued by me, or something. All of a sudden, I look up and I notice, out of the corner of my eye, my friend that I came there with is doing some sort of a titty dance on the bar, right above us. And you can't really compete with that. 'Cause I think that every man hopes and prays that a titty jig is just going to erupt at any moment in their lives.

Drinking is never a problem. Hand to mouth -- no problem. It's quantity over time that's the problem.
Two condoms are walking down a street in San Francisco and pass a bar.  One condom nudges the other condom and asks, "Hey, want to go get s**t-faced?"
===
I don't have much of a memory at all. No, I really don't. I think it's the drugs -- prescription and some under the counter, as well -- but, I mean, it's just gone. I'm really bad with names. I mean, I can meet someone, they tell me their name, I'm looking them right in the eye -- it goes in one ear, out the other. Then I'm just sitting there staring right at him, thinking, 'I wonder if he has any drugs? That's a big pinky nail for a man.'
I'm trying to be a better person. This year my goal is to blackout less; it's a very difficult goal to track. I think I'm succeeding, but I might just not remember failing.

She's not just going to walk up to your house; she's going to try to sneak her way in. She's going to say, 'Girl, let me bring back those brown shoes I borrowed.' You tell her, 'Throw those shoes in the yard and keep rolling because you ain't coming up in here.'
"I met my wife at a singles' bar.""Really?""I thought she was home with the kids."

A young man sits down at a bar and says, "I want six shots of Jagermeister.""Six shots!?" exclaims the bartender, "Are you celebrating something?""My first blow job," replies the young man."Well, in that case," says the bartender, slapping him on the back, "let me give you a seventh on the house."The man holds up his hand, "No offense, sir. But if six shots don't get rid of the taste, nothing will."
A skeleton walks into a bar and asks for a beer and a mop!

It's not that I don't care, I do / I just don't see myself in you. / Another time, another scene / I'd be right behind you, if you know what I mean.
Tequila -- that's what makes you drunk right there; that's what'll get you drunk in the bar. You see, I think that's what the world's divided up into. It's not a man/woman thing or a black/white thing, it's a tequila thing. I think there're people who can drink tequila and there're people who can never hear that word again.

Beautiful.' And you would get your drink, and then the greatest thing of all -- he would keep his ass way over there in the corner and leave you the hell alone.

He went back into the bar, handily flipped his gun into the air, caught it above his head  and fired a shot into the ceiling.      ''WHICH ONE OF YOU SIDEWINDERS STOLE MY HOSS?''    he yelled.      No one answered.      ''ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA HAVE ANOTHA' BEER, AND IF MY HOSS AIN'T BACK OUTSIDE BY THE TIME I FINISH, I'M GONNA  DO WHAT I DONE IN TEXAS!  AND I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE TO DO WHAT I DONE IN TEXAS!''      Some of the locals shifted restlessly.     The cowboy had another beer, walked outside, and his horse was back!  He saddled up and started to ride out of town.      The bartender wandered out of the bar and asked, ''Say partner, before you go. . .what happened in Texas?''      The cowboy turned back and said, ''I had to walk home.''
